The shape was hard to see since the light was fading.  It was bright white on the top and blue, red and white lights were flashing under the craft in random.  It slowly moved within the two hours backwards until the mountain obscured it.  My husband also observed the craft.  There was no noise from it but we were miles away.  The spot it hovered was about \u00bd mile from the Forest Service Tower.  I knew this because I work for the F.S. and knew the exact location of the tower.  As it continued to move I could tell it was moving backwards away from our location at our house over the mountain since it diminished in size.  Again no noise and it was such a clear night and we have a flight pattern over our house and see many planes lights at nights.  It could not have been a helicopter as we heard no noise and we hear so clearly every plane or helicopter in our area very clear.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.
