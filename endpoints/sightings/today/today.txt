They went up and down and covered a good distance in moments.  Then the larger of the two objects seperated into three and kept flying the same errratic flight in the same tight pattern that the two had made initially.  I stopped the car to see them better and did not see them again.  I am a school teacher in Ft Myers FL who has more than a passing interest in UFOs but cannot say for certain that I have ever spotted one before this.  My wife is a housemom.  What was odd about this was the length of time we were able to watch this. Because they were in constant motion and never kept one side facing us for any length of time it was hard to get a good look at the shape.  The closest description I could give would be spade shaped.  There were no lights or trails and the color appeared to be be between gray and black.  I heard about your site on Art Bell's show and hope to hear something about this there.  Hopefully someone was closer or able to see it standing still and was not going 80mph."}
