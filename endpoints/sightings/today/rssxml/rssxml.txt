As that one passed my position, another one behind that. Now I\u2019m watching seven, eight, nine go passed. One of them was different. The only one out of the entire night. It was spinning in a different direction than the path it was on with its buddies. The side I was looking at, was just as bright as the rest. But once it spun its other side around. It was as bright as a strobe. Not strobing, solid light. Nothing about these things were blinking. Just a bright period floating by. At one point a second path was formed, to the side of the original path and light points. It was closer to me, and started a pattern of the same spaces light sources, but staggered from them.

I watched this go on for more than an hour, and had watched more than a hundred go past. When I was able to get my landlord up, he text me about ten minutes later and said he saw what I was seeing. By then, it died down to just about one a minute. They were still coming in when dawn broke and I could hardly see them anymore. So I went back to bed. The next morning I woke up at four, just to see if I could spot anything. I was out there for ten minutes. I spotted three. This morning I tried again. I stood out for about twenty minutes.

Not super fast usually, fairly subtle mostly to the point thay when I first looked I didn't notice.So, I blow it off and start talking and looked away and she insists I look again.

As I stare in awe I begin to adjust my eyes and notice at least 6 other lights but these ones were slighter dimmer than the stars.  They were darting back and forth it seemed!  I pulled my phone out hoping I could use the zoom to see better what was going on.

However, while this was happening and we're staring at the sky at about a 45\u00b0 angle, we witnessed something completely unexplainable and in my mind worth reporting.The sky seemed to have gotten darker out of nowhere...we both felt \"weird\" and hard to explain but it felt like a void, and a temporary breathlessness.  I had the urge to look up because it looked like something was going to fall on us.It appeared of nowhere and I almost wanted to move out of the way.  Then it just floated there for a second like a blimp flying.  It looked like 5 engines or cylinders all attached and white or silver in the shape of a V.  It didn't make a sound and was either car sized or jet sized. It was hard to tell how far up it was because it was so fast and scary.  It honestly was more like an absence of sound and then it took off at unprecedented speed after gliding or hovering for 5 seconds or so.Our best guess as crazy as I know it sounds...is that a portal opened up and a ship came through.  I had chills.  I would have never heard it if I hadn't seen it and wouldn't have been looking without seeing the star looking ufo's so I feel like it must be connected but idk.

Then it just floated there for a second like a blimp flying.  It looked like 5 engines or cylinders all attached and white or silver in the shape of a V.  It didn't make a sound and was either car sized or jet sized. It was hard to tell how far up it was because it was so fast and scary.  It honestly was more like an absence of sound and then it took off at unprecedented speed after gliding or hovering for 5 seconds or so.Our best guess as crazy as I know it sounds...is that a portal opened up and a ship came through.  I had chills.  I would have never heard it if I hadn't seen it and wouldn't have been looking without seeing the star looking ufo's so I feel like it must be connected but idk.  I just don't want to feel like i'm crazy so I need to report it.  My wife saw all the same stuff and felt the same way at the moment that this ufo appeared.

On 4/09/2017 at approximately 23:00, I was sitting at the park and saw a bright white light hovering just above the trees on the eastern horizon.  The light was roughly the size of a street light, but the apparent distance indicates that the light originated from a larger source.  It was blinking but I'm not sure if was in a pattern.  Upon seeing this light, I was filled with a great sense of fear and felt an intense need to go home.After making it back home, I lied down outside to watch the sky some more. At approximately 01:00 on 04/10/2017 (later that same night) the craft reappeared, hovering above the trees on the southern horizon this time.  It was blinking at me the same way, as if testing to see if I was aware of their presence.  I froze, gazed fixed on the bright, blinking light, and suddenly it was gone.  I did not see it leave.Then on 04/14/2017 at approximately 22:00 the blinking light was back.  As soon as I noticed it, it flew away in a direction that was hard to see.  Shortly after, a craft with two solid white lights on the sides, a blinking white light at the front, and a blinking red light at the back made several passes over my house.  I concentrated on these crafts, as they could have been normal airplanes, but the positioning of the lights was unlike any plane that I have seen before.  The next pass (always from south to north) I held my arm up and thought the words \"Is that you?\"  A few minutes later three crafts passed overhead simultaneously. Two from a greater distance, with the two lights on the side and the blinking lights in the front and back, and another much closer.  The one that passed closer to me was diamond shaped, but didn't appear flat, almost like a prism with a glowing orange light in the middle and around the sides.At this point I decided to walk to the park to get a better view of the night sky.  In the distance I could see something hovering that would blink a white light on the left side and a red light on the right side.  I felt like it wanted me to follow it.  I went in the direction that I thought it wanted me to go, and waited for further instruction. I don't think that I followed their directions correctly at first, so I started walking in another direction when one of the larger crafts with the two white lights on the sides made a low pass above me.  I was able to see it more clearly.From below, it was diamond shaped with four smaller diamond shaped quadrants.  The sides where they has the two solid white lights could light up with green or red all across, so I think they were trying to imitate regular airplanes for camouflage purposes while remaining distinct so I could follow them.There would always be one hovering in the distance while the other would make passes above me.  After awhile, I noticed that both of the crafts would alter which direction was blinking white or red, as if to tell me to go in the direction of the white light.They led me a few blocks over, to a side street with a culdesac.  At this point it was around 23:30 and most houses were quiet, except for one.  The house at the end of the culdesac had the garage door open, light on, with a man sitting, seemingly waiting.  I hesitated, for I did not want to appear insane, walking up to a strangers house in the middle of the night with no logical explanation.  The blinking continued in the direction of the mans house, along with another pass from above.  I finally mustered the courage to approach the house, but the man was gone. I started walking home, still watching the sky.Getting closer to home, the crafts appeared to be trying to lead me once again. They brought me through the park, to a dark corner where there were few houses around.  I heard what sounded like two birds chirping at me from the trees, and walked around the area for a moment, looking for signs.The chirping sounded almost like the words, 'Over here,' and when I started to walk away, it changed to a panicked, 'Come back.'  I wasn't sure if my mind was playing tricks on me, but I went back.  Looked around, saw nothing, started walking away again.  This time the chirps were more like high pitched beeps, like an electronic signal.  I turned a flashlight to the tree and saw nothing, but the sound went back to being chirps.  The chirps were telling me 'right here, below you' so I looked around the base of the tree and found a small light that is manufactured by a company here in Phoenix.I've read that an electrical company has had communications with ET life but I have not followed up on the lead as of yet.I saw the diamond crafts again last night (04/15/2017) at approximately 21:30, making several passes over my home, but I was unable to follow them this time.

On 4/09/2017 at approximately 23:00, I was sitting at the park and saw a bright white light hovering just above the trees on the eastern horizon.  The light was roughly the size of a street light, but the apparent distance indicates that the light originated from a larger source.  It was blinking but I'm not sure if was in a pattern.  Upon seeing this light, I was filled with a great sense of fear and felt an intense need to go home.After making it back home, I lied down outside to watch the sky some more. At approximately 01:00 on 04/10/2017 (later that same night) the craft reappeared, hovering above the trees on the southern horizon this time.  It was blinking at me the same way, as if testing to see if I was aware of their presence.  I froze, gazed fixed on the bright, blinking light, and suddenly it was gone.  I did not see it leave.Then on 04/14/2017 at approximately 22:00 the blinking light was back.  As soon as I noticed it, it flew away in a direction that was hard to see.  Shortly after, a craft with two solid white lights on the sides, a blinking white light at the front, and a blinking red light at the back made several passes over my house.  I concentrated on these crafts, as they could have been normal airplanes, but the positioning of the lights was unlike any plane that I have seen before.  The next pass (always from south to north) I held my arm up and thought the words \"Is that you?\"  A few minutes later three crafts passed overhead simultaneously. Two from a greater distance, with the two lights on the side and the blinking lights in the front and back, and another much closer.  The one that passed closer to me was diamond shaped, but didn't appear flat, almost like a prism with a glowing orange light in the middle and around the sides.At this point I decided to walk to the park to get a better view of the night sky.  In the distance I could see something hovering that would blink a white light on the left side and a red light on the right side.  I felt like it wanted me to follow it.  I went in the direction that I thought it wanted me to go, and waited for further instruction. I don't think that I followed their directions correctly at first, so I started walking in another direction when one of the larger crafts with the two white lights on the sides made a low pass above me.  I was able to see it more clearly.From below, it was diamond shaped with four smaller diamond shaped quadrants.  The sides where they has the two solid white lights could light up with green or red all across, so I think they were trying to imitate regular airplanes for camouflage purposes while remaining distinct so I could follow them.There would always be one hovering in the distance while the other would make passes above me.  After awhile, I noticed that both of the crafts would alter which direction was blinking white or red, as if to tell me to go in the direction of the white light.They led me a few blocks over, to a side street with a culdesac.  At this point it was around 23:30 and most houses were quiet, except for one.  The house at the end of the culdesac had the garage door open, light on, with a man sitting, seemingly waiting.  I hesitated, for I did not want to appear insane, walking up to a strangers house in the middle of the night with no logical explanation.  The blinking continued in the direction of the mans house, along with another pass from above.  I finally mustered the courage to approach the house, but the man was gone. I started walking home, still watching the sky.Getting closer to home, the crafts appeared to be trying to lead me once again. They brought me through the park, to a dark corner where there were few houses around.  I heard what sounded like two birds chirping at me from the trees, and walked around the area for a moment, looking for signs.The chirping sounded almost like the words, 'Over here,' and when I started to walk away, it changed to a panicked, 'Come back.'  I wasn't sure if my mind was playing tricks on me, but I went back.  Looked around, saw nothing, started walking away again.  This time the chirps were more like high pitched beeps, like an electronic signal.  I turned a flashlight to the tree and saw nothing, but the sound went back to being chirps.  The chirps were telling me 'right here, below you' so I looked around the base of the tree and found a small light that is manufactured by a company here in Phoenix.I've read that an electrical company has had communications with ET life but I have not followed up on the lead as of yet.I saw the diamond crafts again last night (04/15/2017) at approximately 21:30, making several passes over my home, but I was unable to follow them this time.

Shortly after 23:00 hours we noticed off in the distance at about tree level, 3 objects that appeared to be slightly floating in a triangular formation.  They appeared to us at that 1st distance to resemble large mylar balloons perhaps.  They had a football or oval shape to them, and they glided in perfect formation, in what looked like a triangle at equal distances from each-other.  As the moonlight hit the objects we could tell they were certainly not balloons, and instead had a metallic surface on each of them.  The light reflected off of them similar to how sunlight/moonlight would off of a chrome bumper on a car or other metal object.After they looked like they were hovering for about 10 to 15 seconds, they began a slow rise for another few seconds and then immediately began flying, without any sound at all, at a very quick pace towards us, still up at the top of the trees around our area.  It took them less than 10 seconds to get directly overhead, as they passed us the oval on the left side of the triangle rotated underneath the center oval, and the right side oval rotated over the top so that both the outside objects switched sides within seconds.  The entire time there was still no noise, and once the objects switched sides all three began to climb rapidly up and move away from us to the EAST and then they simply disappeared from our vision. We looked for several more minutes all around our area in the sky but couldn\u2019t relocate these objects at all.  From the 1st second we spotted the triangle formation until we lost sight of them due to them either flying too fast for us or them simply disappearing, it was roughly 45 seconds to about a minute.As for my partner and me, we both work in the retail management world in the Burlington area, we live quiet lives for the most part and just enjoy looking out at the stars, and spending evenings on our deck during the spring and summer months.

Then she noticed it was too big for a plane, didn't have wings and was not making any noise.  She said that it looked like a rocket.  It was moving slowly above the neighbor's house at a bird's flight height and she could see it was grey metallic (matte - not shiny, but the sun was out, it's been cloudy).  She saw the width of the machine, it was smooth overall, but had a large visible structure located towards the end of the body that looked like a propulsion system and some large symmetrical multiple tail type structure.  The machine was about twice the length of the plane and proportionally wider than the plane.  She was on the phone with her mother at the time, but could not turn on the camera on iPhone - it was not working.The machine then made a slow turn without changing altitude and went beyond pine trees on neighbor's property, blocking her view.  By the time my wife went around the neighbor's house, the machine just vanished in the sky.  The dog never even looked up and didn't notice the vessel in the air as it was totally quiet.

It produced a relatively bright orange light, brighter than any star, but not by a whole lot. It was bright enough that it produced a clear halo.

It was as if the object was playing chicken with the helicopter, I almost thought they were going to collide or that the object would attack because it was so low.As the helicopter and object passed each other, the object flew over the helicopter and was probably less than 30 meters above it from my estimation, the object threw out a red almost force field like crescent moon shaped illumination towards its front end.  It completely lit the sky up around it and in doing so it revealed itself. It seemed like a ball of mercury, it was silverish and perfectly round.  The light shown for a few seconds and quickly faded into nothing although I could still see the circular object, as if it were driving with the lights out and there seemed to be very small electrical charges going off in front of it and I literally watched it fade into nothing.I bet anything that the pilots in that chopper saw it too; there is no way they couldn\u2019t have.  It was heading right for them and when it threw that red field out I know it illuminated the inside of their chopper.  So unreal I'm still in complete awe\u2026((NUFORC Note:  Missile launch from Vandenberg AFB at 21:24 hrs. (Pacific).

All of a sudden I heard an increasing in volume thunderous roar, approaching from the north-west.  This made me look up. It sounded like military jet with the pilots really pushing the pedal to the metal.  I did not see the jets, but it sounded like the ones I saw flying over Andrews Airforce base in Maryland.  Commercial jets do not sound anything like that and fly much higher.  (I see a lot of them, since I live about 15 minutes away from Dulles International Airport).  These jets seemed to be flying pretty low and I have never seen or heard them flying over at this time of night - never.  I looked up to see what is making all that noise, but did not see the jets.However, panning the skies from west to south, I saw what looked like a very bright large star, crossing the sky from west to south in the south-western quadrant of the sky. It had the same bluish-white tint to it that the stars do. The line of sight was at about 30 degrees angle to the ground. I could not judge the distance and did not see any shape that might have been associated with the object, but it crossed the sky in under 10 seconds and disappeared behind the trees I have to the south of my house. The strangest thing about the object was that it was blinking in a very peculiar manner. Commercial jets have red and green light, blinking continuously without interruption. This thing was bluish-white, would blink 3 times within approximately 1 second, then would stop blinking all together for a second, then blink 3 times within approximately 1 second again, then stop blinking for a second, etc., during the whole 10 seconds or so it took it to cross the visible to me sout! h west quadrant of the sky. These was no noise at all coming from the UFO directing - the roar I heard was rapidly approaching from the north - west. As I said before, the UFO disappeared behind the trees in about 10 seconds, but I kept hearing the roar for another 5 minutes or so. Sounded like the jets kept flying around. Then everything went silent.Half an hour later the roar came back, but I was already in bed and did not run outside to see what was going on. It would not do any good anyhow, since the speed with which the object moves - it would have been gone by the time I got out.After I got up and came to work, had to tell someone what I saw.

All of a sudden I heard an increasing in volume thunderous roar, approaching from the north-west.  This made me look up. It sounded like military jet with the pilots really pushing the pedal to the metal.  I did not see the jets, but it sounded like the ones I saw flying over Andrews Airforce base in Maryland.  Commercial jets do not sound anything like that and fly much higher.  (I see a lot of them, since I live about 15 minutes away from Dulles International Airport).  These jets seemed to be flying pretty low and I have never seen or heard them flying over at this time of night - never.  I looked up to see what is making all that noise, but did not see the jets.However, panning the skies from west to south, I saw what looked like a very bright large star, crossing the sky from west to south in the south-western quadrant of the sky. It had the same bluish-white tint to it that the stars do. The line of sight was at about 30 degrees angle to the ground. I could not judge the distance and did not see any shape that might have been associated with the object, but it crossed the sky in under 10 seconds and disappeared behind the trees I have to the south of my house. The strangest thing about the object was that it was blinking in a very peculiar manner. Commercial jets have red and green light, blinking continuously without interruption. This thing was bluish-white, would blink 3 times within approximately 1 second, then would stop blinking all together for a second, then blink 3 times within approximately 1 second again, then stop blinking for a second, etc., during the whole 10 seconds or so it took it to cross the visible to me sout! h west quadrant of the sky. These was no noise at all coming from the UFO directing - the roar I heard was rapidly approaching from the north - west. As I said before, the UFO disappeared behind the trees in about 10 seconds, but I kept hearing the roar for another 5 minutes or so. Sounded like the jets kept flying around. Then everything went silent.Half an hour later the roar came back, but I was already in bed and did not run outside to see what was going on. It would not do any good anyhow, since the speed with which the object moves - it would have been gone by the time I got out.After I got up and came to work, had to tell someone what I saw. I told the story to a security guard that I am friendly with and he said that he lives right near Andrews Airforce Base and he heard they scrambled jets several times last night, which, according to him, they never do at night.

I was able to watch it for about 10 seconds give or take as it fell, and noticed the apparent size of the object from my distance meant it could not have been terribly far away---my best guess being it fell somewhere beyond campus in the fields beyond.  I should note that this was at night of course, and my sense of distance could have been skewed, but that object was pretty bright and appeared large from my viewpoint.My first impression was it could have been a lone stray firework, but as I studied it, my impression was that of a fireball.  As the object fell, I saw the clouds off in the distance reflect the red light as the red/green \"fireball\" fell past them.

I was able to watch it for about 10 seconds give or take as it fell, and noticed the apparent size of the object from my distance meant it could not have been terribly far away---my best guess being it fell somewhere beyond campus in the fields beyond.  I should note that this was at night of course, and my sense of distance could have been skewed, but that object was pretty bright and appeared large from my viewpoint.My first impression was it could have been a lone stray firework, but as I studied it, my impression was that of a fireball.  As the object fell, I saw the clouds off in the distance reflect the red light as the red/green \"fireball\" fell past them.

(Derived from the exif data of the first picture.) Approximate location was the City of McHenry, Illinois, the intersection of Routes 31 and Bull Valley road, and traveling South from there, approximately one quarter mile. As I was walking down my driveway to check my mailbox, I saw what seemed to be a kite or windblown scarf, brilliant orange and darker orange in color, it was slowly moving toward me traveling from North to South very slowly, its size at the time appeared to be no more than maybe four feet in any direction.  I did not observe it intensely because it had a motion as though moving up and down as if tethered by a string from the ground, the speed of the oscillations were approximately three or four cycles per second, the range of motion restrained to about twice it\u2019s physical size.  The odd motion had me ready to grab for my pocket Sony camera that I keep with me,  but still not enough to trigger a reaction to take an image, \"no need to waste memory card space,\" I thought. I continued on to check the mail, it had not come yet, when I looked to see where \"the Kite\" was located, all my internal alarms went off.  The object was now abreast of me, it\u2019s path seemed to be about 200 feet West of me, but I had no reference to gauge it's actual size, and it was never directly over me, it was clear to me that something strange was happening, the \u201cthing\u201d was rising up while still traveling due South, now directly West of my position, and abreast of me, any sense of its size was now lost, it may have been much larger than my initial estimate. It is worth noting that the bizarre appearance and motion of the Orange object matched nothing in my mental catalog of known objects, it is almost impossible to even describe it accurately because it looked so strange, it had sharp angles and curves and as it was rising in front of me, it's motions were so fast as to cause it to be a blur as it was close to my position. The motion at this angle were now a horizontal back ! and fort h, as it was rising, same frequency of cycles per second as noted before, about three of four times per second, and still rapidly rising. I did grab my camera, got it turned on, as I lifted it up, the LCD screen was almost completely washed out by the brilliant sunlit sky, I had to approximate the correct direction, the camera is set in bracket mode, it will take a series of three frames, each with a different exposure, one overexposed, one optimized, and one underexposed, usually at least one will be usable, and you can make an HDR image by combining all three together. As I depressed the shutter button, the multi hued Orange \u201cthing\u201d, abruptly faded out within one second, an extremely brilliant strangely hued point source of light popped into view slightly to the south of the orange colored object at the same instant, as the first orange colored one dissolved, the bright light appeared. The distance between the two objects locations was about the size of my fist held at arm\u2019s length. Upon examining the camera images I saw that I did capture the light points but they are quite underwhelming compared to the impact of the actual event. The Sony cameras lens was set to minimum zoom which is 38mm, the average 35mm cameras lens would be 50mm, this means my camera (a Sony DSC T9), was set to a fish eye setting as opposed to a zoomed in setting, this makes the light I saw too small and far away looking to provide images with high detail. The light had an odd purplish blue cast to it a little bit like a welders arc, but strangely different,  to my amazement, this small yet powerfully bright light began immediately moving up and away now traveling Southwest an unknown distance, in just a second, it paused in its apparent movement and ascension, but then engaged in a series of severe and rapid saw tooth type oscillations, occurring within a second, while staying within an imaginary box, the size of which I could not guess due to a lack of references pertaining to size and distance. The small bright light seemed to! have an abundance of energy to burn judging by its erratic and speedy movements. I was taking pictures all the time, the three images are taken in quick succession probably almost occurring within a second, there is a delay of several seconds as the three shots are written to the memory card and then it will take another series of three. The point source light then either dimmed or moved away at an incredibly fast rate, leaving again in a steep vertical climb, with a slight Southwest direction of travel. My initial reaction as it disappeared from sight was that the thing I had just witnessed was very unusual and most likely not caused by any natural phenomenon I am familiar with, the rapid oscillations were so fast that I saw a streaking or elongating effect that happens with fast moving very luminous objects viewed with my naked eye. I would say the after image (The streaking effect.), behind the light source was very noticeable, like rapidly waving a glowing stick of incense in the dark. My impression of what it was is mixed, the first manifestation looked like something solid, but it moved erratically, it seemed to have a physical presence. When the point source of light appeared, it is hard to imagine anything moving so erratically could be moving under intelligent control, the motions were just so extreme. Why would such radical motions be part of its operation or function, it does not make sense. I took pictures, but they are only of use to someone with some computer graphics background, I think someone with some Photoshop skills could overlay some of the pictures and show the trajectory that the object took as it moved away. There are foreground objects (Trees and power lines), in enough of the frames that they could be overlaid to show the differing locations of the light as time elapsed. The digital images do not show any streaking caused by the rapid motion, perhaps because of the bright conditions, the automatic settings most likely would have selected a very fast shutter speed on the camera, or it c! ould be that the object happened to be moving at a slower speed at the moment the frames were taken. The pictures have no value to the casual observer, as far as the wow factor goes. But the testimony I give is honest and true.As for myself, I have a limited educational background, but have always been a scientifically minded person and was an Ultra light aircraft pilot, with a good understanding of weather and other natural phenomena. I enjoy watching YouTube videos and am very skeptical of 99% of the UFO videos and images seen there and elsewhere. I enjoy reading and contributing to the Above Top secret forums, especially those topics concerning alleged UFO activities.  The Chad Drone incident was covered there extensively with hundreds of contributors joining together to analyze the data, eventually a consensus was reached that it was a hoax. In short, this object flew over the wrong person, if it was attempting to be stealthy!  I feel that I am very qualified to make an impartial, detailed report detailing the behavior and visual characteristics of this event.My Flickr account has the images here. http://flickr.com/photos/ring0/sets/72157604542071914/ there are 21 images in all.

150ft big. might of been bigger. so i started to looking more into this, and i couldn't really explain what it was. all i know was it was a huge flame looking thing in the sky.'", "pubDate": "Sun, 16 Jan 2022 02:01:10 -0600", "guid": "http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/reports/062/S62593.html", "link": "http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/reports/062/S62593.html", "shape": {"name": ["NUFORC"]}}, {"DateAndTime": "4/14/07 23:48", "CityAndOrCountry": "Orlando", "StateOrProvince": "FL", "Shape": "Oval", "Duration": "35 seconds", "SummaryIncipit": "Oval fast light traveling over Orlando International Airport in Florida", "DateReportWasPublished": "4/27/07", "DateOfSighting": 20070414, "YearOfSighting": 2007, "MonthOfSighting": 4, "DayOfSighting": 14, "MinimumDuration": 0.5833333333333334, "MaximumDuration": 0.5833333333333334, "CompleteSummaryURL": "http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/reports/056/S56234.html", "CompleteSummary": "Oval fast light traveling over Orlando International Airport in FloridaThe night of April 14th, 2007, around 11:48 pm, we were sitting in the balcony of our apartment located within a mile from the Orlando International Airport facing east.

The area in my view, was a local sod farm and as such, it is slightly wooded around the edges of the property, but mostly a large clear field along both sides of Fairfield Rd, near the junction of Rt. 33 and Brickyard road. The night was bright due to a full moon, and clear. The flashing lights caught my eye a second time, because unlike the many airplanes that pass overhead in the area, they hovered in one spot as they moved from left to right in sequence. I got up off the couch for a closer look, and began to realize that this craft was flying very low and hovering just above the tree line. It hadn't moved like a plane would have out of my view; in fact, it didn't follow any of the many flight patterns I have come accustomed to seeing with aircraft. The lights were very bright and flashing in sequence, beginning with white or yellowish lights, a bright red light in the center and again towards the other end the same white or yellowish lights. As the lights appeared and disappeared in sequence,they seemed to be rectangular in shape(almost like a row of teeth). Realizing this was not a typical aircraft, I frantically ran to get my husband out of the basement, and he came upstairs quickly! At this time we both stared at the object in amazement, not really sure what we were seeing. He ran outside to get a better view fom our deck. Noticing that it was definately a different type of object, he grabbed the car keys and took off in the direction of Rt.9. I stayed home with the children (alseep in their beds), continuing to look out the window at the object. The object hovered a bit longer, and then began to disappear under the tree line out of my view within a few minutes. I checked the time starting to panic a bit- it was 12:18 am. Before my husband returned,another interesting phenomenon occured. I had been watching a pre-recorded DVR event at the time of the sighting and it seems that for some reason- when I tried to switch to live tv mode, thinking the news may be picking up on the sighting ,it stopped working temporarily (the DVR function was on and it stopped responding). In fact, I had to shut it off and re-start the system to acquire a new satellite signal. My husband returned a little after 12:30. He said, he traveled east towards Rt. 9 in the vicinity of T.G. I. Friday's, but lost sight of it. Having been curious to see if anyone else reported this sighting, I googled  Howell NJ and UFO sightings this morning and was shocked that there were two sightings described on NUFORC.com that detalied to the letter, the same exact vicinity we had seen the aircraft!!! I then was convinced I needed to report our sighting. My husband and I both having seen it, and being educated rational adults, we concluded that we can't say for certain what it is we saw, but whatever it was, we agreed that it was : a low flying craft, the lights were many more and quite larger than on a regular airplane or helicopter, and amazingly it hovered (seeming to float) in one spot much like a helicopter would but silently!! Intestingly enough, speaking to my aunt this morning  (on an unrelated topic), who lives a few towns over in Monroe NJ, she commented that last evening the whole area lost cable t.v. power and it had not yet been restored today.  After she told me about the outage, I looked online for a connection between sightings and power outages, and found quite a few interesting instances. There was also an interesting connection between sightings and military installations and or nulear weapons satations.

It was definately an interesting experience, one I will never forget! I know now, that I will no longer hold the skeptics viewpoint, but can with confidence believe that something other than what is known to us publically, can hover over an area silently and more or less fly without a known flight path. Perhaps our technology is evolving. We live near a few military installations and this could be an aircraft that is under the classified testing phase and has yet to be revealed!

PD))CASE BACKGROUND   On 15April05 the Georgia UFO Group received a call on the 'Hotline'. The caller identified himself by name and address i.e. a middle-age disabled resident of McDonough Georgia (McDonough is about 26 miles SE of Atlanta). He stated that the previous night he, along with his wife and a neighboring couple, had observed a highly unusual object in the sky. He went on to describe the event (duration about one hour), indicating that he was pretty amazed by what they observed. After getting the basic details, this investigator instructed the Primary Witness (PW) to prepare a detailed account, plus a sketch, both to be forwarded to this writer. PW also provided the phone number of the second witness (W2).  This investigator phoned W2 and found him to be a retired firefighter, and afterwards a hospital security officer by profession. He provided basic details of the event and also agreed to forward an account and a sketch to GUFOG.  After receiving all of the above described documents on 18April05, this writer again spoke with the PW and W2 within a few days.The final detailed account summary contains more information than the preliminary recap sent to GUFOG members in the group's bulletin.  WITNESS ACCOUNTs- SUMMARY   PW stated that at about 10:00PM on 14April05 (and continuing until about 11:00PM) he observed what he thought was a \"falling star\" out of his bay window. When it did not briefly extinguish as expected, he went outside to observe more closely. Looking to the NW, he continued to watch a brilliant light which began to dart back and forth, up and down, zig-zagging at about 1/2 of the way off of the horizon. PW retrieved his binoculars (10X50) and continued to watch. Under magnification, he at first observed a \"pancake-like\" object which seemed to have red, blue, and silver lights on the bottom. During subsequent observation, it seemed to get closer and MOVE to give a view of DIFFERENT SHAPES......a triangle, later a shallow \"C\" shape almost like a boomerang, then a classic lens shape with a protuberance similar to a cupola, each profile displaying the aforementioned lights. PW indicated that the rapid movement reminded him of the electronic indicator on a heart monitor in a hospital, but after he thought on it some more, perhaps looking through the binoculars had caused some of that due to his natural hand and arm tremor.  After steady observation, the PW called his neighbor, W2, who also came out to take a look.  W2 told this investigator that he watched the object both with the naked eye and the binoculars. He estimated that it was about the size of a LARGE MARBLE held out AAL, at about 45 degrees off of the horizon, shaped like a TRIANGLE with blinking blue, green and silver lights. During his observations, he too noticed very rapid movements. PW added that it seemed to him that the object had a SHINY METALLIC-LIKE COLOR ON THE BOTTOM ALONG WITH THE CHANGING LIGHTS. During his observation using the binoculars he also noticed a GRATE-LIKE SURFACE at one point, which resembled \"criss-cross\" like openings.W2 added that he got the impression that this object was beyond our atmosphere and would be HUGE in order to allow for what they observed.  Local conditions during the observation was a typical mild, clear, Southern spring night, tending to the cool 50's and 60's, with little or no wind noticed.  INVESTIGATOR'S COMMENTS   This writer is intrigued by the many shapes attribute to one object over the course of an hour's observation. However there is a similar recent report on file from the same general area, to wit;   On 3Aug04 at about 5:15AM, a Stockbridge Georgia resident (Stockbridge is about 8.7 miles NW of McDonough) reported to GUFOG via 'Hotline' that he was watching an UNUSUAL LIGHT back in the direction of MCDONOUGH. Said light darting up and down, back and forth, and then as the two of us spoke, he stated that it began to change into a BOOMERANG or V SHAPE. (See NUFORC entry: Stockbridge Georgia; Occurred 8/3/2004; Reported 8/10/2004; Posted 8/11/2004; Shape: Changing; Duration: Appx. 30 minutes)   OTHER FACTORS   In considering prosaic causes for this described event, celestial bodies were reviewed as should always be done for most night reports.  The planet Jupiter is brighter than normal during early April05, estimated about -2.5 magnitude, but BY MID-APRIL is actually FARTHER away from the Sun and Earth than normal.  Venus, due to it's current close proximity to the Sun, is not a factor herein.  GUFOG Special Advisor Mark Ausmus of Atlanta reviewed the sky for 14April05 between 10:00PM and 11:00PM via his \"Starry Night\" software.  Mark found no dazzling bodies that might be brilliant enough, even if viewed through unusual atmospheric conditions, to produce anything remotely resembling what has been described.  Jupiter is off to the SE.....Saturn to the west, but less than dazzling.....Sirius to the west, up about 30 degrees, but again not a suspect.....Capella to the NW, another non-suspect in this particular circumstance.  Witness descriptions obviously do not fit with any artificial satellites, nor meteors.  Both the PW and W2 were found to easily recognize local commercial air traffic for exactly what it is.

However, as the formation approached to nearly overhead (moving from north to south) he realized that he was seeing at least 5 shiny metallic objects (no further apart in the formation than their own diameter), and to his amazement he saw that the objects constantly switched positions as the \"tight S\" formation rather slowly moved south at an estimated 30-50 mph INTO/AGAINST the wind.

(Whether this perception is accurate, of course, is not known.)  Witness observed a military jet a couple of miles away heading in the opposite direction as the formation, but it is not known if that pilot was aware of the formation. Local police and sheriff's departments received no reports, and the FAA had nothing on radar. This, of course, remains an anecdotal, one-person account, but Iowa MUFON investigators are impressed with this individual's careful attention to detail as he sought to satisfy his curiosity over what he was seeing.

Tropicana) when I noticed a strange slightly illuminated shape in the distance. My first impression due to the object's shape and speed was that someone had let off a large cluster of helium party balloons and the wind was carrying them. I thought the hotel and street lights along The Strip were illuminating the object. A few minutes later, I looked up and noticed the object was a bit closer and I became a bit more curious as I began to see some detail. First, rather than being a cluster of objects (aka balloons), it seemed like a more continuous mass where parts of the object had a dull glow of various intensity that changed, as if there were slowly moving parts that were rotating as the object moved forward. The object was about half the size of a fist at arm's length at the closest point as it passed. The object's flight path seem to run parallel along The Strip during the first 10-15 minutes after I first spotted it. And its velocity seemed constant - it moved very slow. In fact, it was pretty breezy outside, so I would think a mass of balloons would be drifting by faster and moving erratically assuming the wind speed was constant higher up. The precise movement of this object gave me the impression as if \"it\" was spying on the activity of The Strip below. It seemed to be positioned right above The Strip but fairly high up. As the object moved further north along The Strip, passing by the building I was on, the lights remained about the same intensity. Again, it's as though certain parts of the object would move every once in a while, causing some of the lights to shift. I could see where from a distance, someone would classify the shape as a diamond at times due to the main illuminated areas being on the ends of the object. However, the shape seemed to change as the lights moved (or illuminated parts moved?). If I were to assign a color to the object, it was a dull mottled color, lighter than a gray, almost like a tan or light brown.! I point ed out the object to a few friends and joked around that it was a UFO coming to join our party. However, my friends were not very sober and lost interest quickly. I, on the hand, was completely sober. I had celebrated a friend's event the night before, so I had decided to take it easy and drink non-alcoholic beverages all night. I noticed at some point, the object made an abrupt turn and started heading westward. The lights did not change as the object moved over an area off The Strip which was not as illuminated, again suggesting the object had its own light source. As the object went further west, it became too small to see and was out of view eventually. The entire sighting was about 20 minutes. Being the rational person I am (I have a B.S. in Biology from a top university) and with all the literature I've read on the UFO phenomenom and common explanations such as military craft, I thought this might have been one of those private, experimental craft that some hobbyists like to build (they look like hang-gliders with propellers). I've read a couple stories where some jokers flew in unison with these craft with lights stringed across and tried to fool the public into believing they saw an extraterrestrial UFO sighting.

Between 02:15 AM - 02:30 AM I was driving my crappy, navy blue '91 hyundai excel on Interstate 287 North between the town of Edison and Piscataway with my friend who would also be a witness.  This part of the interstate is elevated to the point of being a small bridge and so provided us with a good view.  My approximations of distances between the ground up is based on the elevated point from which I and my friend stood. The cloud cover at this time of night was very dense and extremely low, moving at 25 to 30 mph.  The lowest clouds were only 200 to 300 yards above.  It was a very rare sight to see this type of cloud cover here in New Jersey as it is usually only seen in the more southern areas of the United States.  I commented on such nebulous formations to my friend as he too looked up into the sky.  Soon after, I noticed a large light patiently appear from out between the clouds about a 1/4 of a mile away.  I started analyzing it's most awkward arrival with extreme precision.  My thoughts and analyzations were as follows: There's a light the size of a street lamp light up in the clouds... It's a Fire Ball!!! No...it's moving too slow, it would of hit by now. The light that it's emitting is equal to that of a street lamp. Why is it floating above the lowest clouds and under the highest ones? To this I would point and yell to my friend of the unexplainable sight.  We were both frantic. But not as frantic as when the second light appeared from out of the clouds.  I pulled over immediately for us to get a better observation.  It was at this point that we could both see more than just light.  It was an actual physical object.  Very Dark Gray, slightly darker than the clouds.  Once the third light  finally exposed itself we were able to fully identify the shape of the floating object.  It was a perfect triangle.  The lights were located at the ends of each angle, but the angles were not pointed. The were rounded off. My friend and I were sobbing, crying in sheer terror, but we were more overwhelmed with happiness for we knew we were taking part in witnessing the unbelievable. Once we were both able to make full visual contact of the object we became very serious in order to obtain more visual information.  I will now become more descriptively technical so that there is no misunderstanding as to where I was positioned according to the \"object's\" location and my own. Going North on 287 we pulled over to witness the clouds come in from the North West and move South East.  The object also moved in this direction.  It moved in a straight linear axis from left to right where we were standing.  But while it was on this axis it rotated 360 degrees clockwise, patiently, without a sound.  All of a sudden the object in its immense proportions snaps into a perfect 90 degree turn and would begin to rotate instantly into a Counter Clockwise rotation North East from us.  In essence, the object's movements were perfectly geometric.  And so it was with this turn that it would make it's decent into the thickness of the low cloud cover. We could not tell of the object's full dimensions, for we witnessed it from below.  If it was the bottom of the craft that we may have been looking at then we do know for a fact that it appeared flat.

Immediately when I got on Old 85 I saw a bright orb in the sky far away to the south but along the path of the highway. The light was mesmerizing. I watched it intently as I drove the approximately 19 miles home. I did not even listen to the radio (unusual). I watched as the orb would disappear as I went down hills and reappear then I got up the hills. I assume it was just above the tree line. The orb grew brighter and larger.  After passing the Jacob street overpass on old 85, approaching the Highway crossover at the Paradise Hotel. As I approached I could see the orb was a machine hovering the the air just about the treeline. I was shocked and pulled my car onto the crossover there on 85. When I pulled in there was a 18 wheeler parked there in the me! dian at the crossover. I parked my car and got out of my car all the while watching the machine. When I got out I saw the truck driver of the parked truck standing in the crossover. I stood next to him and closely observed the hovering machine. It was saucer shaped with windows around the edge of the saucer and lights below the windows. The lights were red blue green and they came on and went off making it look like they were going around the rim of the machine. The windows were backlit. As we both stared at it in it\u2019s silence we had not spoken a word to each other. I broke the silence and said \u201c Do you see that too? Do you hear anything? What is it\u201d the truck driver said I see it but don\u2019t believe it. It\u2019s making me feel crazy. I don\u2019t hear anything\u201d. We were both calm but amazed and stunned by what we were seeing and not hearing.  I noticed the bottom of the machine was a smooth bowl shaped and was glowing an amber color. We both were just staring. Suddenly the silhouette! of a small big headed body walked to a window and seemed to l! ook down at us. I was shocked. The first thing I felt was fear. I don\u2019t know why. I said, \u201cWhat does it want?\u201d and the truck driver said, I hope it\u2019s not hungry.\u201d We both panicked at the same time and ran to our vehicles and drove away in fear.
