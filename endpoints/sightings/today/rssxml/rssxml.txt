Erratic flight characteristics.On April 15, 2015 11:45 P.M.\tI was working on building a new front porch on my home.  It was nearly midnight. I had to work late on my project because I had been exceptionally busy at work.  I was cleaning up my tools and debris and carrying them west towards my garage.  As I walked I glanced south and saw what I thought was the planet Jupiter.  I spend a time behind the telescope looking at Jupiter, Saturn, etc\u2026 and only because of that fact did I realize that something was out of place.  During that time of night and time of year, Jupiter has already passed the tree tops on the western edge of our property.  Realizing that something seemed out of place, I looked more closely at that the object that I had mistaken for a planet.  The size in the sky looked correct, also the brightness was comparable to Jupiter.\tAt first the object seemed to be just hanging in place, I then wondered if I had mistaken it for another planet but then it started to move.  It kept a relative track of west to south east.  Suddenly, it made a very substantial, very abrupt turn due south, then another, equally sharp correction back to the east, then it began a sweeping arc back to the south. The movement seemed far too sharp for any aircraft that I have ever seen.  I ran in the house and grabbed my 8x binoculars that were sitting next to the door and returned to my front yard.  By the time I returned (roughly 15-20 seconds) the object had really picked up speed.  It was moving far faster than an aircraft.  I yelled for my wife but she didn\u2019t hear me (as she was in the back of the house).\tI got the binoculars on it and could make out very little detail but this is what I saw. It appeared to be triangular in shape, it had one single, exceptionally bright white light that appeared to be centered in the object (it was so bright when viewed through the binoculars it did give the object a bit of an aura), and I couldn\u2019t give a definitive size as I had nothing to compare it to, it had no landing lights, beacons, etc\u2026 just the one light and it made absolutely no sound.  The night was quiet, except for the frogs (which had gone quiet during the event, not necessarily because of the event, as they do that from time to time at night).  As the object began to move out of sight the white light seemed to take on an orange glow, like the moon seen through air pollution, then it just blipped out.  The whole event couldn\u2019t have lasted more than 2-3 minutes.  The angle of my view must have dropped 15-25 degrees in elevation and 30 degrees from right to left as I tracked the object.  The night was completely clear, the temperature was 45-50 degrees.  It seemed very fast but, in fairness, not being able to judge the size or elevation of the object, I couldn\u2019t say definitively, how fast it was actually traveling.  It seemed to move about as fast as a satellite, when you watch them pass over.\tThe object would\u2019ve had to cross over or very near the flight path of Joint Base Lewis/McCord. We lived in the base\u2019s airspace for nearly 4 years now.  I have seen just about every type of aircraft come off that base, from Osprey, Chinook and Blackhawks to F-18\u2019s, C-130\u2019s etc\u2026  I have never seen anything come off that base that resembled, in any way, what I saw that night.  The closest comparison that I could come up with was watching a satellite with the exception of possible size and flight characteristics.\tI did not report this to the authorities because I didn\u2019t want people to think I was crazy. I know it sounds clich\u00e9 but it\u2019s the truth.  I have seen some strange things in my life but I\u2019m sure they\u2019ve all had logical explanations and this may very well have a simple, logical explanation but I couldn\u2019t come up with one.  I found your site while searching the internet to see if anyone else might have reported something of this nature.  I did tell my wife, knowing that I am a very honest and pretty logical person, she believed that I did, indeed, see something but she still had to chuckle when I came in and told her about it.

I noticed some bright and what I thought were distant lights moving slowly towards my direction eastward.   My first thought was that it was a commercial airliner coming straight towards where is was on Bristol Lane in Cotswold Hills.  I don\u2019t usually see lights this bright or commercial airliners for that matter moving in this direction over top of my neighborhood which slightly sparked my interest.The  PHI Airport is a little over 35 miles NE from me and I do see lots of air traffic at night when skies are clear and this was a clear night.   The Dover Air Force Base is about 50 miles south of me.As I looked up and saw the aircraft, I thought is was far away and might have been low flying because it didn\u2019t appear to be high in the sky.  I was still driving and slowed to stop and watch the aircraft as I saw it approaching fairly quickly.  Within about 30 seconds of spotting it in the distance, it was now almost right on top of where I was.

They were pulsing independently of each other.  The red light was a solid and consistent brightness.  As the craft went directly over top of me I noticed it was still making no noise at all.  My neighborhood is very quiet and I can usually hear, jets, propeller p! lanes and helicopters.  There is a farm field behind my neighborhood and no bright shopping centers or main roads are very close to me to create noise or light pollution.Looking straight up I also noticed that the body of the craft is in the definite shape of a large dark triangle because it blocked out the sky in that area which was full of stars this night.  I also noticed now that it was moving very quickly because it was very far away at first but within seconds it was on top of me.

While driving I often look to the sky and try to identify passing air-crafts.  Today, while driving I-10 eastbound in New Mexico and talking to my sister on the phone, I sighted in the southern sky approximately 10,000 to 20,000 ft (altitude)  a large craft comparable to a Boeing 747, hovering in  a stationary point in the sky.It appeared to be metallic with no Navigation lights or wings.  At first it appeared to be cylindrical, I stopped at an exit ramp to take pictures, but my phone was unable to zoom in far enough to take an accurate picture.\tI preceded on down the highway, still watching said craft as it stayed stationary.  I then preceded to contact my uncle, an Aeronautical Engineer, to try and ascertain the identity of the craft.  When we could not conclude on the identity of the craft, he gave me the hotline number for The National UFO Reporting Center.  I then reported my sighting on the hotline number, all the while, still observing the craft.\tIt had remained stationary yet it had now become silhouetted and appeared to have two separate parts of nearly equal size.

It was the middle of the day, 1 or 2 pm, and the sun was behind us.  It was bright and clear, with a few big low clouds.  We had the sun reflect off an object in the sky and glinted us in the eye, like a chrome bumper, or a car window on a sunny day.  It got our attention and we both looked up and saw a strange craft coming out in between a couple of clouds. My wife said \u201cwhat the heck is that?\u201d  I just said WOW.  It was only a couple of hundred feet up, if that.  And maybe 100 to 200 feet in front of us. First thought it was an airplane, but it looked like a big, long rectangular ship, with a little beak on the front.  It was headed up in a steep climb.  It glided between the clouds, with the leading edge disappearing into another cloud, with the rear of the vessel still in the first cloud.  It took a few second for the body of the ship to pass between the clouds before the trailing edge came out. I sat watching to see an airplane wing or tail come out as it passed, but the trailing edge was identical to the leading edge, totally vertical with just a small angle on the lower part of the rectangle.  I saw like a shadow under the craft that looked like an upside down dinner plate.  The angles hanging down seemed to form a saucer shape on the bottom of the big rectangle.  From our viewpoint, I surmise, it was round, with a smaller saucer shape on the bottom.  We were looking straight at it and maybe a little angle from the bottom, as I faintly saw the shadow of the front and far side underneath..  It seemed to be perfectly straight across at the top and bottom.  We could not see what was on the top and bottom, but it appeared flat across from our viewpoint on the ground.  Looked like a bare metal container in the sky, no lights or windows or markings, and it looked all perfectly square and even.  I seem to remember it was made up of big panels.  The thing from the ground and passing through clouds and all seemed to me like to 15 or 20 or so feet high, and over one hundred feet long.  It amazed me the front and rear were so perfectly squared up, and had a little overhang right near the bottom, which I am guessing was the saucer shape.  It moved quickly and quietly and was gone in 5 seconds.  I did not look around or try to see other drivers.  We were both shook up by it and didn\u2019t think to stop.  It looked like an Amtrak passenger car flying through the clouds.  Or a big ship.  Bigger than a 737.  I lived near Detroit Metro Airport in the landing path and delivered mail in Wayne, Mi, just a mile or two from the airport in the glide path.  We saw all types of planes down low inbound and outbound and are familiar with most aircraft.  This was nothing like a plane, and like I say it looked like only a couple of hundred feet away from us, as compared with what I saw landing and taking off in the past.I was kind of surprised almost let down that it was boxy.  I always laughed and said my Honda hybrid looks like a space ship. but this thing looked more like a boxcar than a sleek spaceship.

Upon noticing this dark craft; I backed the video up so as to observe said object at a slower speed; and slowed the speed to 1/8 of full speed.  Upon review, I'd picked up a \"cylindrical\" or \"cigar-shaped\" object, with a light white color moving VERY fast coming from the west, and moving towards the east/northeast; then noticed the darker craft(which had an appearance like that of the \"Baltic Sea\" find). Don't know how else to describe this craft. This was the ONLY craft that could be seen at full speed...fyi.  When this craft came into the picture from the bottom of screen(from the west), I could tell that it did a \"death roll\" and twisted from left to right, then shot slightly further right then the \"cigar-shaped\" object.

Ive been seeing these ufos for over a year now so when i saw it i knew to run to my car and get my camera(that i carry with me all the time now).   On the way to the car i spot another brighter white star below i to the right.  So im looking back and fourth between my daughter(8yrs old) and the two white orbs, when out of thin air a third red orb appears to the right of the white orbs.  They are approaching my location from the east at about the speed of a small plane, at this point im running to my car for camera.  When i get my camera they are just about overhead, the first orb i spotted is quite faint and looks like a small star at a high altitude. The other two however, to my amazement, have changed thier shape.  They appear like two small crescent moons, one bright white the other bright red, and they are slowly spinning.  The spinning motion is not constant, the spinning is fast at times then! slow at other times, going one way then the other.  Both the red and white \"moons\" are spining but independently, at this point even my daughter is kinda freaking out.  The other star like one was still slightly off to the left of the two spinning \"moons\" but kinda just floated along with them from the east to the west.  So now these things are above me and i actually can see them in my cameras view finder.  I do get 8 pictures of the two spinning moon like objects and accidently get a 2sec video. When i got the pics home and inspected them closer i was excited, although the pics don't do the sighting justice some of the detail when zoomed in i could not see with the naked eye.  After seeing the detail ive concluded that they were not only spining they were changing shape. In the pictures you will see the two spining/changing ones, but the third starlike one was there above to the left out of view.

Ive been seeing these ufos for over a year now so when i saw it i knew to run to my car and get my camera(that i carry with me all the time now).   On the way to the car i spot another brighter white star below i to the right.  So im looking back and fourth between my daughter(8yrs old) and the two white orbs, when out of thin air a third red orb appears to the right of the white orbs.  They are approaching my location from the east at about the speed of a small plane, at this point im running to my car for camera.  When i get my camera they are just about overhead, the first orb i spotted is quite faint and looks like a small star at a high altitude. The other two however, to my amazement, have changed thier shape.  They appear like two small crescent moons, one bright white the other bright red, and they are slowly spinning.  The spinning motion is not constant, the spinning is fast at times then! slow at other times, going one way then the other.  Both the red and white \"moons\" are spining but independently, at this point even my daughter is kinda freaking out.  The other star like one was still slightly off to the left of the two spinning \"moons\" but kinda just floated along with them from the east to the west.  So now these things are above me and i actually can see them in my cameras view finder.  I do get 8 pictures of the two spinning moon like objects and accidently get a 2sec video. When i got the pics home and inspected them closer i was excited, although the pics don't do the sighting justice some of the detail when zoomed in i could not see with the naked eye.  After seeing the detail ive concluded that they were not only spining they were changing shape. In the pictures you will see the two spining/changing ones, but the third starlike one was there above to the left out of view.

PDT on April 15th, 2010 in Ventura California.I was looking toward the west at the constellation of Orion when I heard a brief \"screech\" sound lasting around one second and coming from the vicinity which I was viewing. Thinking it was an owl I quickly looked for it and saw a faint silhouette of something moving in the clear sky.  At first it looked like it was a large bird high in the air as the front and two sides were heavily darkened against the mostly dark sky.  It was moving toward me and over a period of about 2 seconds it became clearer and resembled a hang-glider. It was descending and moving toward the east and seemed to be gliding smoothly, making no sound that I could hear.   As it reached its closest point to me, what looked to be several hundred feet or so, a very sharp and definite outline appeared.  It was an equilateral triangle and had three circular areas symmetrically placed near the tips. There was a slight contrast between the gray triangular area and the circular areas, as the circular portions ! had a very faint glowing quality to them.  As it silently continued moving away from me, the craft seemed to have only 2 dimensions.  It looked completely flat like it was a projection.  It began to gently ripple with smooth wave patterns and disappeared within a little over a second after doing so.

Judging from the change in angular diameter, its descent was fairly rapid and it changed from a dark, fluctuating shadow into a crisp configuration, lightly contrasted against the clear dark sky.  I would estimate the base of the triangle to be around 50 feet, though I could be way off.   Once leveled off at around 500 feet, it glided forward at perhaps 100 miles per hour until it disappeared from sight somewhat like a mirage does.

About 20 feet from the shoreline I found a decomposing fish.  I didn't really give it any thought and I certainly did not want my dogs to find it, start eating it and get sick so I picked it up and tossed it into the woods.Several days passed.  Again I took an early morning stroll around the lake checking on the spawn.  Odd as it may be, I came upon another fish (a largemouth bass) in much the same condition as the one I found earlier that week and only a few feet away from the first.  Having NEVER seen such an incident in the 42 years since building that lake, I was compelled to take a better look at this fish.\tUpon closer inspection I saw that there were several parts of the fish missing.  The area behind the anal fin was gone and looking closer it appeared the entrails were also missing.  Some bones could be seen in that open area but it seemed the spine was no longer there.  There was also a hole to the right of the spiny dorsal fin that also allowed viewing the area that was missing behind the anal fin since it was now \"gutless.\"  The bony plate around both eyes which meets the operculum was gone as well as both eyes were cleanly missing.  The tissue that separates the pelvic fins and running to the underside of the mouth was there, However, the tissue from the pelvic fins up to the pectoral fins was gone allowing a straight-through view to the other side of the fish as well as a view through to the hole above the anal fin.None of this seemed to be the work of a predator - of any kind.  I've seen the work of predators and this certainly was not.  Since 1972, when the lakes were built, I have seen only two fish \"belly up\" in this lake; two largemouth bass.  One had tried to eat the other.  Being both the same size, both fish perished, one stuck firmly in the mouth of the other.  But I have never seen any fish twenty feet off shore, especially not in this condition.But what struck me as being truly odd was the hole next to the spiny dorsal fin.  It was perfectly round.  A 5/8\" (15.95mm) perfectly round hole!  Fascinating!  No predator can make that hole.  Not with that kind of precision.  I researched the possibilities everywhere.  Even my local Pennsylvania Fish Commission and Game Commission could not attest to any predator being capable of making such a perfectly round hole like this one.  But somehow, somewhere I recalled some literature that mentioned a hole of this size (also perfectly round) being common on many cattle and other animal mutilations.So I contacted Linda Moulton Howe, told her my story and she was more than taken in with this tale.  She never heard of a fish mutilation in thirty years of research.  This was news to her and she was interested in taking this further.  I sent her the pictures I had taken from various angles which peaked her interest further.  What she needed to know was there any evidence of thermal damage around the edge of the hole, such as would be made by a laser or something that would produce a high degree of heat.  I was now on a quest to find someone (with credentials) who would be willing to perform such tests and provide an affidavit with the results.  I tried dozens upon dozens of colleges, universities, fisheries and independent laboratories to take my case of the mutilated fish.  Not a single person was willing to join me in the search for this critical evidence.So, Mr. Davenport, there you have it.  This can possibly be the first case of a mutilated fish in the realm of \"high strangeness\" as Linda would say.  Then I learned you obtained a degree in fish biology and genetics.  Why hadn't I known that before?  I've followed your career for many years. I've listened to you on Coast for years, first with Art, now with George.  I wrestled with the thought of asking you for your help in this matter for months.  Everyone else turned me down for two reasons I've learned; 1) When they learned it might have something (or anything) to do with an extraterrestrial presence and 2) Because their salaries came from the universities, laboratories or wherever, they did not want their name on an affidavit stating the results they would find fearing a loss of their job.Now I ask the same of you.  Would you be willing to become involved in this matter or even discuss it with me?  As much as I hate to admit failure, I may have to tell Linda I've come to the end of the road, so to speak.  The long road I have traveled no longer has a fork, instead a large red stop sign may be staring back at me.Thank you for taking the time to read this, I greatly appreciate it.Kind Regards,  ((name deleted))((deleted)) Road Conneautville, PA 16406-2031 814-((deleted)) Home 814-((deleted)) Cell Amateur Radio call sign ((deleted))((NUFORC Note:  We have looked at the photos provided by the witness, and are unable to certify that the wound to the fish's body is necessarily unusual.

The lobes were oriented to each other like four people sitting at a square table with an x connecting one person to the person sitting directly across from them.It was hovering perfectly still and noiseless about 200 yards to the northeast of my position and about 150 feet off the ground, right in the middle of town in the middle of a week day.It took 20 or 30 seconds for my mind to catch up with my eyes, after all I was not expecting to ever see anything like this so I think my comprehension of it was a bit delayed.

By this time the entire port was looking at the sky (1000's of people).  There was no sound coming off these objects.  The phenomenon carried on going right across the nightsky and the fireballs only started fading and disappearing when they were almost out of sight to the far East (they had appeard in the west).   I have seen meteor showers before but never have they been anything like this in terms of quantity, intensity and how close they seemed above the Earth's surface.  Very strange indeed.  I don't think they could have been more than 15-20kms above us, however they must have travelled 100's of kms in the space of 60-90 seconds.  Has anyone got any explanation for this phenomenon?'", "pubDate": "Sun, 16 Jan 2022 02:01:10 -0600", "guid": "http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/reports/050/S50136.html", "link": "http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/reports/050/S50136.html", "shape": {"name": ["NUFORC"]}}, {"DateAndTime": "4/15/06 23:00", "CityAndOrCountry": "Round Rock", "StateOrProvince": "TX", "Shape": "Light", "Duration": "20 Seconds", "SummaryIncipit": "Bright white object that moved extremely fast and appeared out of nowhere.", "DateReportWasPublished": "10/30/06", "DateOfSighting": 20060415, "YearOfSighting": 2006, "MonthOfSighting": 4, "DayOfSighting": 15, "MinimumDuration": 0.3333333333333333, "MaximumDuration": 0.3333333333333333, "CompleteSummaryURL": "http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/reports/051/S51644.html", "CompleteSummary": "Bright white object that moved extremely fast and appeared out of nowhere.My friend and I were driving back to my house.

Anyway, towards the end of the walk, on our way out of the park, we stopped to relax and fly a kite on the mound.I laid down on the grass, at the top of the mound, wearing my sun glasses, and started looking around, just taking it all in (again this day was different somehow illuminated), and noticed kind of an aura above the trees that line the park.  I'm commenting to my boyfriend all the beauty that I am taking special notice of, and laying on my back I look straight ahead and a little to the left and I notice what at first glance I thought to be birds darting back and forth at each other.

I even lost track of them for a few seconds even though there were no clouds in the way, maybe they were moving so fast I could'nt see them.The whole time I'm witnessing this, I'm yelling for my boyfriend to lay next to me to see what I'm seeing, he laughs at me and contiues to fly his kite.  He missed out on a once in a lifetime experience.  I was afraid to take my eyes off the area, afraid I would lose sight of them.

Just for the record, I am Canadian, but now living and working in Shanghai, China, as a teacher. I've been living in Shanghai for now two years and this happened sometime around April 2004. Anyway, I was going to the supermarket with my girlfriend in Shanghai, China, near Jing An Temple area. All of a sudden, I noticed something like a fireball in the sky. At first I thought it might be a meteor or something like that but as I have seen a meteor/comet previously in my life, I quickly felt it probably wasn't, mostly because of the extremely slow speed this object was moving at.  After looking more carefully, I noticed it looked more like a huge, red glowing object with 3 visible glowing parts and a long red/fire-looking trail.  It was moving very slowly towards west. Suddenly, I noticed that there were other gray objects moving very fast around it!  Perhaps 2 or 4 of them, I am not sure as many were visible at the same time.  Once again, at first I thought it was something normal, just like jet fighters.  But that's when it got very interesting!  These smaller, gray, oval shaped objects were actually traveling at speeds and in a way that I've never, ever seen in my life.  I think its worthy of mention that I grew up near an airport in Canada and every other year we have this huge air show I always attended.  I've seen a huge variety of army aircrafts in action, including F-15s, F-18s, Vertical take off planes, F-117 (stealth airplanes) and so on so I can safely affirm that in my opinion, there is no way these could have been any aircrafts that the world knows of.  These objects could stop all of a sudden, disappear, show up again, go up, down, in a way that is not possible by any know aircrafts. Anyways, these objects seemed to move around and follow the bigger, fire-orange, glowing object with a big trail behind it. I could observe this for about 5 minutes before the big object disappeared behind tall residential towers with the smaller objects seeming to fade away as well. This happened almost a year ago but immediately after the event I went home and tried to somehow put into images what I've seen while it was fresh in my mind.  As I'm a web designer and being very familiar with the Flash software, I decided that the best way to make this look as close to reality as possible was to reproduce the objects in photoshop and animate them with Flash.  So I took a picture from the same place I observed this and put that picture as the background.  I then added the big glowing object and tried to make it move at about the same speed as It was moving.  Lastly, I've added the smaller, oval shaped crafts and tried to animate them as close to the way they moved as possible.  I think the result is very very close to the reality of what I saw that day and I hope I could share this with the rest of the world as well. The only thing that might be slightly different from the reality is the fog, which is difficult to reproduce properly. During the actual sighting these objects were very slightly less visible than that because of the fog.

Color was like all colors of the prisma, but subtle like a cut diamond. The objects were at least 5 a 6 times the size of the biggest stars we could see As they where looking at it they spotted a few more. She told me to come outside and see for myself. They spotted at least 6 other objects but 2 of them I have seen with my own eyes. IF you looked very concentrated it looked as if there were three light or that they where triangle. One of the objects was in front of the house and one on the other side of the house. The distance was far, but objects were subtle changes in color. In the south of the Netherlands were i live, we don't have so much light pollution and it was a clear sky, so the view was perfect. The object on the northside of the house, was there for about 2 and a half hours. In a steady position, so stars where moving, but not the object. We ran a few times from the front to the back of the house, and i was also running in and out of the house posting messages on http://www.angularmomentum.net and ran upstairs to a friend of mine, the building is the old townhall of Hoensbroek, so we live with few more people there. I asked the guy if he ever seen a ufo, his girlfriend was there too, and she thought I was joking, I got them to the window on the other side from where they live and the object was there. Clearly visible. My friend looked at me in disbelieve, but his girl was enthousiast what she seen. I ran down again and one of hour neighbours who was walking the dog late, was curious what we where looking at, when I explained she was like totally amazed.

I am sure we will have more sightings here because I have seen three of them on two occasions, but my girlfriend has seen more as she had a better view from that roof terras. Maybe i can ask her if she can send you guy's a report, because she has seen objects coming out of objects, but that was high up in the athmosphere. Also satellites were that night clearly visible. I am from Amsterdam and there is no stars in the sky, to much traffic lights, here in Hoensbroek you can look at the milky way, quite amazing.

We have been watching for half an hour and i have been checking on it every ten minutes and it was there until a two hours later when. I am sure we will have more sightings here because I have seen three of them on two occasions, but my girlfriend has seen more as she had a better view from that roof terras. Maybe i can ask her if she can send you guy's a report, because she has seen objects coming out of objects, but that was high up in the athmosphere. Also satellites were that night clearly visible. I am from Amsterdam and there is no stars in the sky, to much traffic lights, here in Hoensbroek you can look at the milky way, quite amazing. I talked to my friend upstairs a few days later and he told me he had never seen anything like it.

They were on their way to my office and were only a couple of minutes from my front door when they spotted it. The object was about 1/8\" diameter at arms length and was clearly visible. The sky was absolutely clear with no smog or clouds. It was described to me by her son, who is 12 and a half years old as a saucer shaped object with a line at its girth separating the top half from the bottom. Interestingly, the top half was described as rotating on its axis while the bottom was stationary to the top. My girlfriend's son also described some purple and blue flashes that were being emitted from the surface of the object. He described these as flashes that would have the perspective as if you were looking into a tunnel. After viewing the video, these are clearly visible. Also, from his vantage point where he saw the object lower on the horizon, these would have been more in direct line with his line of sight and would have given him this tunnel perspective view. In contrast to this view, my video shows the object directly from its bottom. The object was hovering motionless for several seconds when two airplanes crossed ahead of it. These two airplanes were seen by both the mother who was driving and the son. Immediately after the planes crossed each other's paths, the object disappeared from view until the two planes were a fair distance away. It then re-appeared and began moving westward into the wind direction. Upon arriving at my office, they both frantically called out to me to get my video camera out, that there was a UFO. I immediately grabbed my camera and went out to take a look and hopefully get a shot. When I first viewed it, it was about 65 degrees off the horizon looking due east. I was in the parking lot of my office complex situated directly at the corner of Lomita Blvd. and Madison. I took my 5X telephoto lens with me to make sure that I got a good close up shot of it. It was climbing steeply and getting smaller very quickly as it moved westward. It was very hard to get a fix on it with my long lens. I simply couldn't find it fast enough, so I laid down on the pavement to steady the camera pressing my elbows against my ribcage. I found it and got about 4 seconds of video and quickly lost it again. In my video, it appears that the UFO is jumping around, but it was in fact moving very steadily. It continued west for about ten seconds, then took a fairly sharp turn to the north, crossways to the wind. It continued north with apparent slowing as it was climbing very fast until it was out of sight. I immediately took the video into my office where I have several computers and image processing programs. Upon looking at it, I not only got a very good shot of the object even though it was nothing more than a speck in the sky, but was able to get a few good frames of these purple and blue flashes that my girlfriend's son had described. When I looked at with my naked eye, I did not notice these probably because the object was so small. I took some of the frames and began doing some computer enhancements using only the hue, saturation, brightness, contrast, histogram, midtone enhancements and so on to bring out what detail that might be obtainable from the unchanged original video frame.

They were on their way to my office and were only a couple of minutes from my front door when they spotted it. The object was about 1/8\" diameter at arms length and was clearly visible. The sky was absolutely clear with no smog or clouds. It was described to me by her son, who is 12 and a half years old as a saucer shaped object with a line at its girth separating the top half from the bottom. Interestingly, the top half was described as rotating on its axis while the bottom was stationary to the top. My girlfriend's son also described some purple and blue flashes that were being emitted from the surface of the object. He described these as flashes that would have the perspective as if you were looking into a tunnel. After viewing the video, these are clearly visible. Also, from his vantage point where he saw the object lower on the horizon, these would have been more in direct line with his line of sight and would have given him this tunnel perspective view. In contrast to this view, my video shows the object directly from its bottom. The object was hovering motionless for several seconds when two airplanes crossed ahead of it. These two airplanes were seen by both the mother who was driving and the son.

We had a perfect view of the light as it moved and we noticed that it would speed up a little then slow right down. We sped up in the boat to get closer and the light continued to move away a little faster but with the same speed up and slow down movement.

They are not intended for others to see or judge me by. Please forgive me for writing down these observations.  I am a hard working man focused on making a living for my wife and family.  I do not make things up.  The observations I am writing about actually happened to me.  I was never going to write about them, but then today I decided to make a few quick notes about my experiences.  I have two college degrees in science and have worked in the medical field for over 30 years..About 10 yrs ago, I lived with my wife in an upstairs apartment. I was the only one home that day. It was a spring day at about 10 AM.  I went to the bathroom and as I was leaving the bathroom, a bright orange object shot by me faster than my eyes could follow it.  It was about the size of a dime (0.25\u201d diam), it came from my left(east to west) (bathroom window sill on left is about 5\u2019 above floor and window was open) and went to my right at about shoulder height (decending at an angle of 10 deg toward the floor).  When I looked to the right to follow the object, it was gone in less than a split second and all I could see was the closed bathroom door. Needless to say, I was startled; the object came within 1 ft of me.  My eyes only gazed at the closed door for a second and since there was nothing to see, my eyes returned to the center (normal position).  Then, to my surprise, the orange ball streaked back in the opposite direction (to my left going west to east) toward the bathroom window.  Again it went so fast that my eyes couldn\u2019t follow it.  I looked to my left and it was gone.The incident shook me up.  I have to admit that I was frightened and shaking for a few minutes. I immediately went to the bathroom window and looked down and up.  There was no one down below, all the surrounding buildings were only one story, (so no one from another building could be playing a prank on me with a laser pointer), and there were no airplanes or helicopters in the sky above. I left the bathroom and looked around the apartment and noticed that all the the windows had the drapes closed.  I immediately ran outside the building and looked around.  No one was there.  I wanted to knock on doors and ask neighbors if they saw anything, but I stopped myself.  I would have made a fool out of myself.I calmed myself down,  I had a busy day of work ahead of me.  I tried to convince myself that I was just seeing things that weren\u2019t really there (an optical illusion or a malfunction of my optic nerve, or brain).  But, the fact that the object came back and went the other way made me think it was real.  Still, to this very day I refuse to speculate on what it could have been.  The only thing I know for sure,is it did occur, and I try not to think about it.  I am only writing this down for my own notes about life.  About how things happen to people that can\u2019t be explained.I had this same bazaar experience a few weeks later, while I was walking out of my bedroom  in the hall between the bathroom, bedrooms and living room.  The orange ball flashed by me at about shoulder height. I can\u2019t remember the exact direction it came from, but I do remember it was a different direction than the event in the bathroom.  I don\u2019t remember if it went in front of me and then came back the other way as it did in the bathroom.  It occurred at about the same time (around 10:00 AM).  The hall was dimly lit as all the drapes were closed.  I was the only one home.  I was startled but not as scared as the previous time.  I looked around inside and outside the apartment as and found no one or nothing out there.I even went to get my eyes checked after these experiences.  The doctor told me that a detached retina would be a blinding flash of white light over my entire visual field.  So this anomaly was not caused by a detached retina.  I don\u2019t fantasize or make up stories to entertain myself so this was not the result of that.  In fact, I wish I had NOT experienced these events. Nevertheless, it did open my mind to the possibility that there are things going on around us that we may not be totally aware of.Nothing like this ever happened to me before or since then.  It has been more than ten years since I observed this anomaly.  I was too busy to write down what happened at that time and I really shouldn\u2019t be taking the time to write about it now.  I didn\u2019t want to scare my wife, so I didn\u2019t tell her what happened until a month later.  I just wanted to know if she had encountered anything like this.  She told me she had not seen or heard anything unusual.  At first she thought I was joking, but when she realized I was serious, she became frightened.  I calmed her down by telling her since nothing bad had happened to us, there was nothing to worry about.  This experience, changed the way I look at the real world.  It made me ask myself many questions: \u2022\tWhat if the orange ball that flashed past me would have me hit me?  Would it have damaged my body?  What if it had already hit me on another occasion and I didn\u2019t know it? \u2022\tWhy did I see it?

They are not intended for others to see or judge me by. Please forgive me for writing down these observations.  I am a hard working man focused on making a living for my wife and family.  I do not make things up.  The observations I am writing about actually happened to me.  I was never going to write about them, but then today I decided to make a few quick notes about my experiences.  I have two college degrees in science and have worked in the medical field for over 30 years..About 10 yrs ago, I lived with my wife in an upstairs apartment. I was the only one home that day. It was a spring day at about 10 AM.  I went to the bathroom and as I was leaving the bathroom, a bright orange object shot by me faster than my eyes could follow it.  It was about the size of a dime (0.25\u201d diam), it came from my left(east to west) (bathroom window sill on left is about 5\u2019 above floor and window was open) and went to my right at about shoulder height (decending at an angle of 10 deg toward the floor).  When I looked to the right to follow the object, it was gone in less than a split second and all I could see was the closed bathroom door. Needless to say, I was startled; the object came within 1 ft of me.  My eyes only gazed at the closed door for a second and since there was nothing to see, my eyes returned to the center (normal position).  Then, to my surprise, the orange ball streaked back in the opposite direction (to my left going west to east) toward the bathroom window.  Again it went so fast that my eyes couldn\u2019t follow it.  I looked to my left and it was gone.The incident shook me up.  I have to admit that I was frightened and shaking for a few minutes. I immediately went to the bathroom window and looked down and up.  There was no one down below, all the surrounding buildings were only one story, (so no one from another building could be playing a prank on me with a laser pointer), and there were no airplanes or helicopters in the sky above. I left the bathroom and looked around the apartment and noticed that all the the windows had the drapes closed.  I immediately ran outside the building and looked around.  No one was there.  I wanted to knock on doors and ask neighbors if they saw anything, but I stopped myself.  I would have made a fool out of myself.I calmed myself down,  I had a busy day of work ahead of me.  I tried to convince myself that I was just seeing things that weren\u2019t really there (an optical illusion or a malfunction of my optic nerve, or brain).  But, the fact that the object came back and went the other way made me think it was real.  Still, to this very day I refuse to speculate on what it could have been.  The only thing I know for sure,is it did occur, and I try not to think about it.  I am only writing this down for my own notes about life.  About how things happen to people that can\u2019t be explained.I had this same bazaar experience a few weeks later, while I was walking out of my bedroom  in the hall between the bathroom, bedrooms and living room.  The orange ball flashed by me at about shoulder height. I can\u2019t remember the exact direction it came from, but I do remember it was a different direction than the event in the bathroom.  I don\u2019t remember if it went in front of me and then came back the other way as it did in the bathroom.  It occurred at about the same time (around 10:00 AM).  The hall was dimly lit as all the drapes were closed.  I was the only one home.  I was startled but not as scared as the previous time.  I looked around inside and outside the apartment as and found no one or nothing out there.I even went to get my eyes checked after these experiences.  The doctor told me that a detached retina would be a blinding flash of white light over my entire visual field.  So this anomaly was not caused by a detached retina.  I don\u2019t fantasize or make up stories to entertain myself so this was not the result of that.  In fact, I wish I had NOT experienced these events. Nevertheless, it did open my mind to the possibility that there are things going on around us that we may not be totally aware of.Nothing like this ever happened to me before or since then.  It has been more than ten years since I observed this anomaly.  I was too busy to write down what happened at that time and I really shouldn\u2019t be taking the time to write about it now.  I didn\u2019t want to scare my wife, so I didn\u2019t tell her what happened until a month later.  I just wanted to know if she had encountered anything like this.  She told me she had not seen or heard anything unusual.  At first she thought I was joking, but when she realized I was serious, she became frightened.  I calmed her down by telling her since nothing bad had happened to us, there was nothing to worry about.  This experience, changed the way I look at the real world.  It made me ask myself many questions: \u2022\tWhat if the orange ball that flashed past me would have me hit me?  Would it have damaged my body?  What if it had already hit me on another occasion and I didn\u2019t know it? \u2022\tWhy did I see it?  (I do not believe I was chosen to see it, or there was a message to me in seeing it, I think it was just a random event) Why did it flash by and then come back the way it came?  Why did I experience this anomaly twice?  It is pointless to speculate on the causes of this anomaly, so I try to put it out of my mind, but something tells me I should record these events.\u2022\tHave other people encountered anything like this? \u2022\tWhat other things are going on that people observe, but dismiss them as illusions, or say to themselves, \u201cWhat I just saw couldn\u2019t have happened, so I must be seeing things.\u201d Or people might think to themselves, \u201c It didn\u2019t really happen, so I should just forget about it.

After having my cup of coffee with the employees on this April morning I got on my security golf cart to finish my round. As I was driving out of the main packing shed I saw what at first appeared to be a helicopter shining a bright light over a company truck shop which was located about half a mile away from the plant. Many people were walking towards the plant because the morning shift began at six am, but only a few stood there looking at the light.Out of the people that stood there looking at the light I singled out a supervisor. I got of my security golf cart and walked up to him and asked what he thought the \u201chelicopter\u201d was looking for (as for me, I knew this was no helicopter, even though the plant was located near highway 99 and we saw our share of high-speed chases, but this time, the light was not here in our sky as we know it, this light was coming from really high up in the sky)? The supervisor answered it was a space shuttle and it was going to land in the Mojave Desert. I answered by saying the light was very slightly moving towards the north east, and Mojave is to the south east. At this point he stayed quit and just watched the light. I then radioed my partner and asked him to take a look at the \u201chelicopter\u201d shining the light on the truck shop (when using the radio we needed to maintain serious due to management listening in on our radio conversations).

Driving North at approx 21:30 at night along the coast road we saw a bright orange light in the distance that resolved into 2 orange lights side by side.  Passing under the lights I looked out the car window to see a triangle shaped object hovering approx 100 metres above us and approx 20 degrees to one side of our vehicle.The orange lights that we could see from a distance were no longer visible. We pulled over and crossed the road where we were close to being underneath an object that had several large red and green lights underneath, with a large central white light. There were small winking lights on the 2 outside (wings) of the delta shape. We could clearly see the outline of the craft and that it was silent and hovering in place. The craft was an isosceles triangle that appeared to be the size of a small civilian aircraft in width. Only one other vehicle passed us during this time and the passengers ignored our efforts to point out the object.

It stayed the same altitude and we watched until the craft had moved off into the distance and out of sight. Since the craft had moved off in the direction of our home suburb I told the boys to keep a lookout. We encountered the craft crossing the main highway approx 8 kilometres from where we first saw it. We turned down the nearest street to pace the craft that was slowly following large power lines behind suburban housing. At this point we noticed 3 smaller winking lights come in at speed from the surrounding night sky and join with the object.

PAI was out fishing with my father that evening, and we were returning home, when noticed a super bright white light hovering across the street from our home--I would 100 to 150 feet away.  We both initially thought it was a helicopter with a search lights.  These lights were white and were arranged in a single row of three.  They were so bright that you could only look at them directly for a very short period of time.  Also, because the lights were so bright you could not see the object that was emitting the light.  We initially stopped our car on the road in front of our home and watched the lights from inside the car for about 5 minutes.  After the lights went out I quickly pulled the car into our driveway at which time we both got out of the car.  I then looked in the direction which we see the lights and I then spotted a 30-40 foot black triangle--all sides were the same size.  The triangle had 5 pinkish/orange lights (close to the color of a sodium vapor street light) on each side of the mid-section of the craft.  The craft started to move very, very slowly towards us like it detected our presence.  As the craft got closer, I ran to the side of the road, and it was at this time directly the other side of the road.  The craft was only a two lane road without shoulders away and it was just about the telephone poles.  It was so close I could have thrown a stone at it and hit it.  While it was directly across from me I could see the top and bottom of the craft was flat/non-reflective black in color and I didn't see any seams or joint.  The mid-section was a flat/non-reflective; dark grey color and the pinkish/orange lights were being emitted from hemispherical globes maybe 3 or 4 foot in diameter.  The mid-section also had narrow, vertical ridges which were cylindrical in shape and were as tall as the mid-section, which I would estimate to be about 8-10 feet in height.  The lights were steady and didn't blink or change intensity.!  The craft continued to move slowly following the edge of the! road.I walked with the craft following it from the other side of the road until I reach the edge of our property.  The craft continued to move down the road until it took a right turn, which the craft did not bank or change speed.  I saw the craft go on the far side of my neighbor\u2019s house and head out over a field that is behind my house.  I stood on a little berm a watched the craft make its way out over the field-the speed or its altitude never changed.  After it made its way out over the field, when it was approximate 200-250 feet away, it just blinked out.  It didn't zoom away at a high rate of speed, it just simply disappeared.  I was dumbfounded by this and stood there in total disbelief for another 10 minutes or so.  The craft never reappeared, it was gone.  I never felt scared at any point, I felt totally calm the entire time.  I had the awareness to check my watch from the very beginning of the sighting and the event lasted roughly 15 minutes and there was no missing time involved.  This event occurred on April 20, 1995, between approximately 1:15 - 1:30 AM.  The craft emitted no sounds, no smells, and no heat.  I didn't see anything that looked like a convention aircraft engine.  The craft's motion was very slow and fluid, no wobbling or jerkiness.  Even though the sighting occurred 22 years ago, until this very day I cannot get that event out of my mind.  Whenever I get idle time during the day or night I automatically start thinking about it.  I often times have dreams involving UFO sightings, which seem extremely realistic. I have had other strange events happen to me after that sighting which I'd rather not discuss at this time.

It was VERY cold. (The cold is my primary memory of this night). I had two teenagers, one preteen, one todler two adults and one tent. About 2300 I was trying to rearrainge the beding to provide some relief from the cold. Went to my pickup for a ground tarp. My ex-wife had abandoned the tent and was sleeping in the cab of the pickup with the engine running and the heater on. The kids were all with me in the tent. As I recall, the pickup engine stoped for several minutes; Tina woke up and nearly wore out the starter trying to get it going again. Vehicle was 1969 GMC 1/2 ton (with several dozen USMC sticker on it). I heard a sound that I initially thought sounded like a water fall. Looking up, I saw a large object that I initially thought was 4 military helicopters flying in a formation. I did not see any red or green lights, only white ones. I then noticed that the stars behind the paralagram formed by the four lighted helos were occulted.  The sound was not the typical (womp womp womp) made by military helos (I spent 2 years in the Marine Corps and 6 years in the Navy, I know what helos sound like.)  It sounded more like a waterfall, using a bass voice. The object(s) were traveling slowly west to east. Their speed was about the same as a flight of helo as seen from the ground. It is difficult to guess the altitude, however I have seen military helos overhead many times. The altifude of this object(s) was similar. The shape was not square, or prehaps square seen from an odd angle. Assuming a 3 to 2 ratio of the object, (3 lenght and 2 width) the northern leading light was 1.5 units farther east than the leading southern light. At the time I \"assumed\" that it was military aircraft with a net or something strung between them, but I remember the sound. It was not a normal helo sound.

As I recall, the pickup engine stoped for several minutes; Tina woke up and nearly wore out the starter trying to get it going again. Vehicle was 1969 GMC 1/2 ton (with several dozen USMC sticker on it). I heard a sound that I initially thought sounded like a water fall. Looking up, I saw a large object that I initially thought was 4 military helicopters flying in a formation. I did not see any red or green lights, only white ones. I then noticed that the stars behind the paralagram formed by the four lighted helos were occulted.  The sound was not the typical (womp womp womp) made by military helos (I spent 2 years in the Marine Corps and 6 years in the Navy, I know what helos sound like.)  It sounded more like a waterfall, using a bass voice. The object(s) were traveling slowly west to east. Their speed was about the same as a flight of helo as seen from the ground. It is difficult to guess the altitude, however I have seen military helos overhead many times. The altifude of this object(s) was similar. The shape was not square, or prehaps square seen from an odd angle. Assuming a 3 to 2 ratio of the object, (3 lenght and 2 width) the northern leading light was 1.5 units farther east than the leading southern light. At the time I \"assumed\" that it was military aircraft with a net or something strung between them, but I remember the sound. It was not a normal helo sound.

We were in what is called the Croom section of the Withlacoochie National Forest, and all three of us are university instructors.

The object(s) moved slowly (I don't know which direction--we were in the woods, at night) and disappeared.  It took probably 15-20 minutes. The next morning, one of the witnesses (my husband) and I went out birdwatching; I left him to finish by himself (too many blackflies) and he disappeared.

I do not know what it was you witnessed that night, but I agree with your assessment that it almost certainly could not have been a conventional aircraft. Is there any possibility that you could reconstruct the precise date of the sighting?  For example, do you have a record in a bird-watching diary, fuel receipts, or something along those lines, that would permit you to establish an unambiguous date for the event??  Is there any possibility that the sighting could have occurred in March 1994? Thank you again for sharing the information with our Center!

We went with a large group of \"horse people\" (the campgrounds are primarily used for horseback groups) and one is still a friend of mine.

There was a short mention in the local news about \"local man missing in forest,\" that sort of thing, and really, by missing I mean gone.

I was on a down hill slope and looked up at the friend who was also on a large wood pile. I seen directly over his head in the distance a large Disk. It was four times bigger than the house( which would make it wide as a football feild and tall as a three story building. The best was I can describe it is - someone drew it in the sky with a pencil and then erased it. I could see it but at the same time I couldnt. Basicly transparent, the only way I seen it is because I was looking right at it when I was looking at my friend.  Me and my brother seen it at the same time and yelled to the friend.  He turned around and fell down from the quick shock. Being far away the first thang we could think to do was run to it so we could make out what it was. In our we asumed that it wasnt aware of us but as we ran close it droped down and dashed out of sight. No flames , no sound , and it was gone in less than a sec.  No human could live through those g-forces and what ship do we have that fast with no sound. Every one we told did'nt understand. I was about 12 and know im 24. I have found jesus and here latly I have been talking to people about what I seen and I have a lot of questions for the lord when I reach hevan. As for now I pray what I saw is answered in time.

I'm a church going person and I'm not sure what to think of what I seen. A friend, my brother, and my self were playing in the yard about 120 yards away. I was on a down hill slope and looked up at the friend who was also on a large wood pile. I seen directly over his head in the distance a large Disk. It was four times bigger than the house( which would make it wide as a football feild and tall as a three story building. The best was I can describe it is - someone drew it in the sky with a pencil and then erased it. I could see it but at the same time I couldnt. Basicly transparent, the only way I seen it is because I was looking right at it when I was looking at my friend.  Me and my brother seen it at the same time and yelled to the friend.  He turned around and fell down from the quick shock. Being far away the first thang we could think to do was run to it so we could make out what it was. In our we asumed that it wasnt aware of us but as we ran close it droped down and dashed out of sight. No flames , no sound , and it was gone in less than a sec.  No human could live through those g-forces and what ship do we have that fast with no sound. Every one we told did'nt understand. I was about 12 and know im 24. I have found jesus and here latly I have been talking to people about what I seen and I have a lot of questions for the lord when I reach hevan. As for now I pray what I saw is answered in time.

I do know however that I was having a good semester and it was warm outside which leads me to thinking it was the spring of 1990 or 1991, making me about 21 or 22 at the time.  I lived at mom's house then and my bed was situated such that my head was directly below the window.  The window had one of the first model of storm windows that were marketed about 20 years ago which I think is significant because it was partly responsible for waking me up at I don't know what time but it had to be between 1:30 a.m. and 4:00 a.m. I woke up because the window was vibrating and I heard a sound coming from somewhere.  I gathered my senses enough to really wonder what the hell that low humming sound was, I for a second thought it was a semi tractor trailor idling out in the street of our neighborhood, but I knew the sound could not be that.  So I sit up to look out the window and can't really see anything, but I know that from whatever the sound is coming it is close by.  So I stand up and feel kind of like I'm hazy-sleepy, like when you fight getting out of bed in the morning, stand up and feel kind of a head rush, sort of.  But I AM very aware at this point, just going against some resistance.  I walk out onto the deck behind our house that is directly attached to my room.  I look left, down the street, to the house where the Mort family used to live before the people that live there when this event occurred.  I can't remember their names now, Lothman maybe, but they had two little children and we practically never saw them in the several years they lived there.  It is a good sized house about 250 yards down the street, sitting up on a hill, a three story house that really sticks up from where it sits.  Above that house, I saw it instantly, was the space ship.  It was saucer shaped I guess, but not pointy.  Shit wish I could draw it for you.  Since I can't...it was fucking big, but not too big.  The house I'm guessing is 60-70 feet wide looking at it from the front which I was, and the ship was at least 50 feet wider, and I'm guessing about 30-40 feet thick.  It looked like a fat saucer, like you take a rubber ball, the size of a tennis ball, and squeeze it by pressing it on a table untill it is 3 to 4 times longer than wide, but with a slight bevel leading up to the center consol on top.  The top and bottom were distinct.  It was hovering about 20 feet directly their house.  It was definitely using caution because it had all its lights off except for a row or two that were very dimmed, all the way around, plus up at the Cabin I gues! s for lack of any better word.  I could not see it doing anything.  I did know that the sound was coming from the ship.  And when I stood there staring at it for about 1.5 minutes I could really tune in the sound and feel it stronger now that I realized it was really there.  What I felt was that it was very low frequency, and it had an almost intoxicating effect on me.  I thought that this is what they are using as method to ensure that everyone in the neighborhood remains sleeping.  Especially since it was actually quite a soothing feeling, such that I now realize that I was just standing there staring at this thing for 3 or 5 minutes just amazed and nothing else.  Then I realized that they knew I was looking at them.  And I remember thinking to myself and to them, \"I don't care what you're doing here, just please don't do anything to me.\"  Then the craft raised up silently above the house about 100 feet, then it just took off like you would expect from an advanced ufo.  So fast that it just left a streak.  When it left on two vectors.  First to the right slightly, up and away for about an inch of streak, then back slightly to the left and straight away at an upward angle out of the atmosphere I imagine leaving a big streak. I have no other evidence than this story.  I would certainly like to investigate that family who lived in the house the ufo was over.  This is the only written version of this event, although I have told a handful of people over the years since it happened.  You can call me for a drawing if you want.  I'm no artist but I can try.  Thanks for your interest.  Let me know if this experience is worth anything, I would appreciate the kickback.  But don't get me wrong I am honest to God writing this as it happened to me, and its certainly not for any other motivation other than to present the story to someone who will actually find it yet another piece of evidence to support that there really are ufos.  I guess I have to believe there are.  I just hope to God there is never an Independence Day.  Thank you.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

Those \"lights\" were far from us, above a dark hill next to my neighborhood not that high in the sky, exactly aligned to the front of my eyesight. I was puzzled and I asked my BF who was facing me to take a look and I asked him what it was. He took a quick look and told me those were helicopters. I quickly answered back: \"unless there are two helicopters next to each other just standing there....\" and then I noticed it couldn't be because there were 3 lights forming an obtuse triangle and helicopters just don't stop in the sky NEXT TO EACH OTHER.I wanted to believe my BF, so I said goodbye, came inside the house, closed all the windows (that my parents would always keep open) and went to bed shaking. I calmed myself down and fell asleep. Next morning I called my best friend as I usually would do every morning and the first thing she says is: \"do you remember last night when you dropped me home and we saw the guy's cars outside but the guys were not there?\" Since my best friend was a quiet, smart girl the way she was trying to tell me something was wrong made me feel as scared as the night before. I asked her what happened. She said that when she went inside her house the guys (her brother and his friends) were inside, scared, and told her that minutes before they were out in the street as usual when they saw a round light standing there in the sky and then they saw smaller lights coming into the bigger light and then separating away. They went up to the roof of the house saw the lights for a couple of minutes and then the lights flew away.Then I believed what I saw was a UFO but I tried to supress the memory of it until now.FYI, I lived in the rural part of town, SouthWest of \"downtown\" Cabo Rojo and my friend lived East of the center of downtown Cabo Rojo, which is a 5 minute drive away.

Those \"lights\" were far from us, above a dark hill next to my neighborhood not that high in the sky, exactly aligned to the front of my eyesight. I was puzzled and I asked my BF who was facing me to take a look and I asked him what it was. He took a quick look and told me those were helicopters. I quickly answered back: \"unless there are two helicopters next to each other just standing there....\" and then I noticed it couldn't be because there were 3 lights forming an obtuse triangle and helicopters just don't stop in the sky NEXT TO EACH OTHER.I wanted to believe my BF, so I said goodbye, came inside the house, closed all the windows (that my parents would always keep open) and went to bed shaking.

No sound came from it, it stood in the sky before us revolving slowly.  We felt we were also being observed during the time it presented itself to us.Heading east one evening from Yuma on our way to Phoenix with our 2 young children, I sat in the back with my baby while my husband was at the wheel with my 2 yr. old daughter in front.  As I looked out the window to the south night sky, the sun had just set and the mountains were gentle shadows against the sky.  As dusk turned deeper into night my attention was drawn to a very bright round light which was brighter than a star, and not as high up.  I called my husbands attention to it, but he said it was probably the planet \"Venus\".  I watched for sometime, not able to look away, wondering what it could be.  When I did look away, then back, I didn't see it, it had gone.  I was more curious now wondering if it was indeed Venus, where had it just gone?  I told my husband it was gone.  He than suggested it was a Helicopter doing Military operations out there in the desert.  In Yuma we were currently stationed at the Air Station there, and operations were performed frequently in the night.  I continued searching the sky for the light.  Suddenly it appeared, only it was abit closer this time.  I excitedly told my husband, \"there it is!\"  He was now becoming abit curious due to my persistance.  His next explanation after taking a glance from the road in the lights direction, was perhaps it was a flare.  I didn't take my eyes off the light this time, looking for the tail that a flare would have after being shot up or down, there was none.  Suddenly stunned as a second light pops on directly next to the first light.  Now I yelled at my husband that another light, the same bright color is shining brightly next to the first.  Continuing to drive he also began to lean forward and down, to peer out the window.  He saw the 2 lights, and then suddenly they were gone.  THe best way I can describe the way they became \"gone\" was they just blinked off.  One minute they're there, the next they're gone.  The same way you would flip the light switch turning the light off in a room.  Now my husband was as curious as me, and c! ontinues driving, and looking out the window.  With in moments, the single light appeared again, this time the closest it had been up to this point to our car.  It was approximately the heighth a power line would be to a car on the road.  Upward, slightly, but not directly above us, still to the side of us.  So the single light is on, the second light appears next to it, and then a third light pops on.  At this point as my husband says, \"That ain't no damn helicopter\", fear gripped me as this thing took shape before our eyes.  I realized what we were looking at, and it appeared to be looking at us.  After the third light appeared on, the light was so bright that we could see the shape of a round saucer, but it wasn't a flat structure.  It had a top shape to it, and under the lights we could see slightly up into the  center of the craft.  There was something there, but it was shadowy and hard to see what it was.  It stood there in the sky slowly revolving, allowing us to observe it, no noise coming from it.  My husband is now all over the road, while trying to drive and look at the same time.  I was more afraind than I've ever been in my life.  I felt myself bordering on pure panic, I couldn't believe my eyes, and yet there it was in front of me.  Unbelievable!!  But there it was.  My husband wanted to pull over, and I was screaming no!  Then, as quickly as it had appeared, the lights popped off again, and we couldn't see it.  Feeling abit safer only momentarily, but pressed for time I told my husband to pull over so that I could drive.  I had the intention of course not to stop once I was behind the wheel.  But I wasn't sure what he'd do if the craft appeared again, he might stop which terrified me.  We quickly pulled over to make our exchange.    I jumped out of the car, still panic stricken and jumped into the front seat screaming at him to come on!!  He hesitated looking up into the sky in the direction we had seen the craft in.  He was excited, exhilirated, but scared too, just not as scared as me.  He! 's much more of an adventurer than I.  Finally he got into the car at my insistance, and we took off.  Our conversation was filled with questions.  I remember my husband thinking out loud saying, \"I wonder if they can hear us in here (the car) like by the radio or something (which wasn't on at this time).  Just after he said that the craft appeared again.  We both felt as though it was their way of answering his question.  This time it was farther away again, but still within good eye shot.  This time the lights did somthing different.  Suddenly the 3 lights split off from each other into a triangular shape.  They shot off quick from each other, 1 light becoming 3 seperate lights.  As I've later learned this triangular shape  has been reported by others, and In spite of all the sightings that I think are bull shit, when I hear someone talk about the triangular significance I believe they've seen something.  Anyway, our trip continued and we could think of or speak of nothing else of course the rest of the way into Phoenix.  The lights continued to reappear to us, but at a greater distance over the desert mountains.  We watched them all the way into Gila Bend, and then saw them no more.  This trip is still vivid in my mind, and there were some peculiar things about the whole thing.  First thing was, after the experience we looked behind us, and ahead of us the highway was completely vacant.  We were the only ones there at that time.  This led us to feel as though we were chosen to be shown to.  I remember distinctly feeling that we were chosen.  We wondered why we'de be chosen, but couldn't come up with anything.  My husband was full of regret as though he'd missed an opportunity of a life time to be \"picked up\", and he talked about how he wished we had pulled over, maybe they'd have picked him up.  I was so terrified by the experience that I couldn't and still don't understand his thinking, but I do remember feeling very strongly as he expressed his \"missed opportunity\" that we would see it again. This imp! ression was so strong at that moment, and it was only there after he'd expressed his remorse at the thought of missing out on what could have been an abduction.  My children were unaffected by the whole thing.  My daughter now 14 has vague memory of the incident, and my son was still a baby at the time remembers nothing.  The night sky took on a whole new meaning to us after that.  And every trip we took from Yuma to Phoenix thereafter we had our camera with us with night film available to photograph anything should it appear again.  There were endless trips after that to visit our family  in Phoenix, but never again did we see what we'de seen that night in \"88\".  As all the UFO sightings became more reported, and numerous photo's and abduction storys surfaced I'd have to say many of them I feel are not legitimate.  There are always people who want to jump on the band wagon.  Personally I think some people that make their abduction stories available are simply full of shit.  They have wild imaginations, and they have discredited those of us who've truly had an experience with sightings ect.  I am as skeptical as the next person, and would welcome an explanation for what we saw.  The simple facts are, I know what we saw.  I don't know why we saw it, but I know something is out there, I don't believe it, I know it.  I don't know why certain people are chosen, maybe it's simply chance that these sightings occur, but I feel somehow that we're chosen.  The only significant thing that has happened to me since then are some very vivid dreams of large, colorful, UFO's bigger than ever seen before.  I also had a dream where I was picked up and taken to some terminal like location.  In the dream upon arriving at my destination I was taken into a room that was all red, walls and all.  I stood waiting in this room, and out from a partition came an alien child, I sensed she was female, and somehow we were connected.  I felt no fear as I stood looking at her, and she stood smiling at me.  Very strange dream, very vivid.! I awoke wondering what it meant.  I still look to the sky and wonder when another UFO will appear to me.  OF all the UFO photographs made public, I'd have to say the craft that I saw, looks most like photo's I've seen taken in Gulf Breeze Florida.  Ironically, I now live about 20 min. from Gulf Breeze, but have yet to see any UFO's.  We never reported our sighting, although I wish we had.  I wonder if there would have been some explanation, or maybe someone else who may have seen the same thing that night.  But my husband being a military member hesitated.  We know that a good deal of the public still doesn't believe in UFO's and discredits those of us who've seen one.  For now we continue watching and waiting for the proof to be shown to us all.", "title": 93, "description": "In Yuma/Tacna AZ on 4/15/88 19:00 for approximately 15.0 to 30.0 minutes witness reports: 'roundes craft with lights around the outer rim.

After finishing its turn the disc leveled out and cought up to the airliner.  Both continued flying in a northerely direction.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

It is very difficult to establish what the light is in the photo.  Given that it is not possible to know its distance from the camera, facts such as the object's size, velocity, etc., are all not able to be calculated, in my opinion.  I do not know how even Kodak would have been able to determine that the object was moving at a high velocity.Hence, given the information available to us from your report, the object remains just an unidentified light, to the best of my knowledge.Did you note the object at the time of your sighting, or see it later while examining your photos.  Also, was your camera on a tripod, at the time of the shot?Thanks, again, for sharing the information with our Center! Cordially, Peter Davenport((RESPONSE FROM WITNESS))Yes, it was on a tripod. When I took the picture I was unaware of the object.  Kodak measured the light trail and compared it with known flying ormoving objects.  This was not the regular Kodak lab that you have access to.I have in many years of flying all over the world seen many other flyingobjects and about 6 years ago I was driving into town and saw a bright redorb that I felt was over the area of my house.  At this time the cloud layer was about a thousand feet and decending as it ofthen does here in the valley. I was five miles away and having flown thosands of hours I'm a pretty good judge of where things in the air are around here.  I called my wife and she went outside and saw it several hundred yards from our house over new construction on the I-5 freeway.  When I got home it was still hovering in place below the cloud layer.  About twenty people were outsidewatching it.  It was bright red, the light coming from within.  It did not pulse, just glowed.  I called the tower chief at the airport 2 miles away.  The cloud base was 300 feet.  As I pulled off the freeway going north at Market street it was directly ahead of me over the roadway.  When I got home it was directly east of my house. Allowing me to see it from three sides. It stayed there for another half an hour for a total time since I saw it of about 45 minutes.  It appeared to be about the size of a large auto.

However, as I remember it, I was traveling on a 2-lane highway with my grandpa and older cousin.

Around the center of the object was an oblong oval shaped disc.  It looked like a big belt all the way around it.  Within the belt there were approximately four circles of light.  These circles were glowing red, green, and purple, and seemed to be alternating color schemes.  I would estimate that the object was around 200-250 yards away, and was located in the horizon where the corn field, and woods seemed to meet in the distance.  While watching the object, I remember being almost hypnotized by it; I had never seen anyting like it.  In fact at that time, I a positive that I did not know what an alien or a UFO was.  The craft just hovered the where the woods and corn met.  As it hovered it was emitting small twinkling lights down to the ground.  As one line of lights went to the ground, there was a second line of lights that traveled upwards into the craft. The whole time this was happening, my cousin was screaming and yelling.  After about a minute of observation, I snapped out of my fixation and asked him what it was.  He replied \"That's a UFO!  It has some aliens onboard who are probably going to kill off everyone and destroy the earth!\"  \"They are going to blow everyhting up!\"  Being 7-8 years old, I was pretty impressionable so naturally I believed him.

Enter E-W slow bright. Outside stared obj <5m. Time on clock, >1h. Hypn 5 yr later. Abduct, exam, unsettling.I was sole percipient, had insomnia one night, sat inside bedroom gazing at night sky approximately 0100 on 041584.  Saw a blazing white light enter field of vision from east, moving to west.  A dead pine tree served as a reference point.  Object halted behind the tree.  The motion of falling leaf was observed briefly.  Object stayed in sky throughout sighting.  Feeling some compulsion to go outside, I watched it from the back yard for what I thought was only a few minutes.  The weather was cool and I was not fully clothed, so felt cold.  I noticed the object seeming to drift slightly westward, still looking like bright blazing star.  Suddenly it moved about 90 degrees to the west, without transiting.  Tired, cold, I went in, sleepy finally, and went to bed.  Told someone the next day at work about it, got laughed at and forgot it for three years.  The book Communion was published, the cover startling me and triggering a memory of that night.  For two more years I thought about it often, reading Communion and some other things on UFOs.  In 1989 I had a hypnotic regression to the night in question, remembering in detail being taken up through the air to the object, taken aboard, examined, having communication with the occupants, including some joking and prophecy.  The object appeared to have a considerable amount of detail on both the outside and inside.  The occupants were short, gray-brown in color, and wearing red suits with black trim and some sort of smooth, tight-fitting head gear that seemed to cover a part ot their faces. They stood away from the table I was placed on, behind a half-wall.  A scanning device examined me.  I got a very good look at it such that I can see it as I write this.  There were several instances of the occupants joking with me to relax me and quell my fear.  There was an instance of forced physical paralysis with total loss of muscle control.  I kept my eyes closed during much of the experience.  At the end, two of them floated me back to the yard between them.  I was unable to look closely at them out of fear, and had a screen memory of their appearance.  The content was bizarre, odd, and frightening.  I left the hypnotherapy session very upset.  For several years subsequently I had a hard time with the memory.  The session was taped.  I transcribed the tape and studied it carefully.  There was an internal coherency but the content was very unusual.  Later, I read that the things that the occupants discussed (telepathically) were not so unusual in abductions.  I saw another clinician, a published author and psychiatrist who studies paranormal events.  Two more abductions were uncovered, going back to childhood.  Another emerged spontaneously.  One of them explained a mysterious short term leg paralysis that I had as a child.  Many pieces fell into place about bad memories from childhood, fear of windows at night, always looking into the night sky, and three previous sightings I had had.

The mother had a conscious waking memory of her experience, which happened also when the daughter was four.  A sister only could remember the screen memory of a wolf's face at the window.  Another sister remembered from childhood a screen memory of white horses with large, black, glassy eyes staring at her inside her bedroom, then chasing her across the house.  These sessions went on with this patient for over one year, often meeting three times a week for two to three hour hypnotherapy sessions.

Enter E-W slow bright. Outside stared obj <5m. Time on clock, >1h. Hypn 5 yr later. Abduct, exam, unsettling.I was sole percipient, had insomnia one night, sat inside bedroom gazing at night sky approximately 0100 on 041584.  Saw a blazing white light enter field of vision from east, moving to west.  A dead pine tree served as a reference point.  Object halted behind the tree.  The motion of falling leaf was observed briefly.  Object stayed in sky throughout sighting.  Feeling some compulsion to go outside, I watched it from the back yard for what I thought was only a few minutes.  The weather was cool and I was not fully clothed, so felt cold.  I noticed the object seeming to drift slightly westward, still looking like bright blazing star.  Suddenly it moved about 90 degrees to the west, without transiting.  Tired, cold, I went in, sleepy finally, and went to bed.  Told someone the next day at work about it, got laughed at and forgot it for three years.  The book Communion was published, the cover startling me and triggering a memory of that night.  For two more years I thought about it often, reading Communion and some other things on UFOs.  In 1989 I had a hypnotic regression to the night in question, remembering in detail being taken up through the air to the object, taken aboard, examined, having communication with the occupants, including some joking and prophecy.  The object appeared to have a considerable amount of detail on both the outside and inside.  The occupants were short, gray-brown in color, and wearing red suits with black trim and some sort of smooth, tight-fitting head gear that seemed to cover a part ot their faces. They stood away from the table I was placed on, behind a half-wall.  A scanning device examined me.  I got a very good look at it such that I can see it as I write this.  There were several instances of the occupants joking with me to relax me and quell my fear.  There was an instance of forced physical paralysis with total loss of muscle control.  I kept my eyes closed during much of the experience.  At the end, two of them floated me back to the yard between them.  I was unable to look closely at them out of fear, and had a screen memory of their appearance.  The content was bizarre, odd, and frightening.  I left the hypnotherapy session very upset.  For several years subsequently I had a hard time with the memory.  The session was taped.  I transcribed the tape and studied it carefully.  There was an internal coherency but the content was very unusual.  Later, I read that the things that the occupants discussed (telepathically) were not so unusual in abductions.  I saw another clinician, a published author and psychiatrist who studies paranormal events.  Two more abductions were uncovered, going back to childhood.  Another emerged spontaneously.  One of them explained a mysterious short term leg paralysis that I had as a child.  Many pieces fell into place about bad memories from childhood, fear of windows at night, always looking into the night sky, and three previous sightings I had had.  Of those, one was multiple witnessed by parents and their friends.  No subsequent UFO activit! y occurred to me.

From a distance away I could see something up ahead that I had never seen before.  I traveled that road every day. That particular day I stayed later for a meeting.  As I came upon the circle which connects Route 1 and Route 130 in North Bruswick, there was a HUGH circular craft hovering over the circle. It was HUGH, the size of a city block.  It made no sound, just hovered.  It had colorful lights on the bottom.  I pulled alongside the highway near what use to be the NJ Boys Scouts Headquarter and just sat and gawked at it.  Many people had parked along the highway to observe.  I left before it did.  I wanted to rush home to bring back a family member to see it but no one believed me when I told them about it.  I never went back.

My cousin and I were doing what we usually did at 15 on a weekend night by riding our bikes to the next street off of Main street to sit by the railroad tracks to watch the frieght trains go by. It was a cloudless night with no wind. We were sitting on a concrete foundation connected to a warehouse just off the road about 60 or 70 feet from the railroad crossing watching cars slowly go across the double rail lines. We were hoping for a slow moving train to come by so we could throw rocks at the rail cars and see the sparks fly. That happened a time or two and we found ourselves sitting there as it got later looking at the sky. We were talking and I noticed in the sothwest a blinking out of stars as I gazed at the sky. I didn't think anything about it at first because I was looking at the sky through a tree in the distance. I just thought the limbs of the tree might be moving because of a slight breeze that I could not feel from where I was sitting. A few more minutes passed as I watched the \"blinking out\" continue above the tree. Then I realized something was strange and I asked my cousin if he could see it. I had to point in the direction and he saw what I was talking about. We just watched as it approached about 30 degrees above the horizon and that was when we realized it was a moving solid object. It had no lights at all and actually was darker than the moonless sky. I remember saying to my cousin at that point, \"what is that\"? He said \"I don't know\". It was almost overhead by now and was being underlit to some extent by the lights on Main street. It was a perfect triangle and looked to be fairly low in altitude. Maybe 600 to 800 hundred feet and about about 3 inches between the forefinger and thumb at arms lenght.  I ran out to the rai! lroad tracks to get a look at it as it passed over the two story warehouse and I lost it in the city lights. At that point I don't remember us saying a word but we both jumped on our bikes and sped to my parent's house about a 1/4 mile away where my cousin spent the night.

My wife and I were traveling South on Interstate 75 in the Spring of 1975, we were making a trip to the Ft. Lauderdale area to check things out.  I liked driving at night because there was a lot less traffic and much nicer traveling.  I remember very clearly that night I saw the UFO, there was no mistaking what it was.  It was approximately 2AM in the morning and my wife had fallen asleep while I was driving South.   I remember it was a very beautiful night that night and there was not a cloud in the sky.   I even remember sticking my head out the driver side window to look at the constellations a few times.  It was South Ga. and there were no city lights and the stars were magnificant that night, like I said, not a clould in the sky.  Then, all of a sudden, the entire Interstate highway in front of me was completely lit up as though it was daytime.  The road is very flat in that part of S. Ga, so I could see cars for several miles in front of me on both sides of the road.   I was amazed that the whole Interstate was suddenly lit up in a manner very similar to the light when a large lighting bolt lights up everything.  But there were no clouds or lightening bolts that night, only perfect weather.  As the light stayed lit, I began searching the sky and my view from left to right trying to figure out where all the light was coming from... Then I saw it perfectly through the rear passenger window, as it was just hovering in the sky.  It was enormous!   At first it looked like a full moon because it was a perfect sphere, but it was 10 times the size of a full moon.  It was only a couple hundred yards from the Interstate, and it was very low to the ground.  I couldn't believe my eyes!  I knew exactly what it was the second I saw it because I knew we don't have any technology that is perfectly a sphere, can hover like that, and 10 times the size of a full moon.  And, the colors were amazing.  The whole sphere was a solid bright green color, and all around the perimeter the light colors appeared to be a red and organge flashing of colors.  My guess was that the perimeter colors of the sphere was reflecting the propulsion system as they went completely around the sphere.  So here I am, still driving but totally focused on looking at the amazing, huge, bright colored sphere.  Then, as I was looking at it through my passenger rear glass, it went from standing still in the sky to shooting 180 degrees across my front windshield.  It went from standing still, to completely across my horizon in less than 2 seconds.  I had no doubt whatsoever what it was knowing that we have never had technology that can move that fast.  Then, I noticed that I was just approaching an Interstate exit, I was in the area of 20 miles north of Tifton Ga.  The exit had one of those very tall gas signs which use to be so popular.  As I was approaching the exit, my wife suddendly woke up in an absolute panic.  She started screaming, stop the car, stop the car, the car is on fire!  I immediately said to her to look at the tall gas sign, as I wanted her to see that the sign was complete enveloped in a type of smoke from the UFO.  She saw it, but it took me a minute to convince her that the car was not on fire.  But what really happended was that she was smelling the smoke left behind by the UFO as it tore across the sky at light speed and the reason I asked her to look at the tall gas sign, was because she was sleeping when I saw the UFO and I wanted whatever proof she could still see, I filled her in on the details later.  Oh yea, one more thing that always amazed me, the smoke actually smelded like honeysickels.... Really!  It did not smell like smoke at all, it was absoultely the sweet smell of honeysickles.

It was evident that these lights were round in shape. The time was approximately 9:30pm - it was dark by now. The colour emanating from them was like bright headlights, white with a slight yellow hue, yet they were above the trees.I am a mother of 6 children and of sound mind and character. I don\u2019t make stuff up.I live near a very large, deep and pristine lake in NE Alberta, Canada.  My home is nestled in a forested area adjacent to one of the many bays of this lake, named Cold Lake. To the west of my home, approximately 4 miles, is the largest jet fighter Air Force Base in Canada. I am very used to and familiar with seeing and hearing these jet aircraft on a regular basis. What I witnessed this night was very different.After a few minutes of gazing upon this anomaly, one of the lights sped away in a westward direction. Its take-off or acceleration was like nothing I had ever seen in a conventional aircraft, jet, helicopter, prop-plane, whatever.  One could compare its take-off to the release of an arrow from a bow.  Also, there was absolutely no sound. I would estimate their distance away from me at \u00bd mile or less. This left 2 lights still in place above the trees. Given the estimate of \u00bd mile distance away, the actual size of the lights would likely be somewhat larger than virtual headlights.No structure, definition or appendage to the lights was visibly evident; it was a dark night.Upon my arrival home, one block from my initial visual, my son, very excited, asked if I had noticed the lights above the trees over there? I responded with, \"\u201cyes\", of course! We discussed the matter briefly, including the one that got away and decided to investigate further.The lights were hovering over a marshy area. The water was lit up due to the proximity of these lights emitting upon it. The light would pulsate seemingly on a timed or regular basis. It is important to note that there are no roads where these lights appeared; the only road is the one to my house. I state this so that no one will have notions that they were motor vehicles; how could they be?  At the time of this sighting we had 5 dogs. Don\u2019t ask why, we just did. As the light decreased from full intensity to zero light or pulsated from normal to no light, the dog\u2019s hair would stand straight up on their backs and they would bark, acting erratic in nature. When the light returned to normal the dog\u2019s behaviour did too.I said that my son and I were going to investigate further and so we did.  At approximately 10:00pm we decided to drive around to the top of a nearby knoll hoping to get a better view.  The lights were still visible but somehow appeared to have moved to a more distant location.  We watched them (the 2 remaining lights) for about 10 minutes and then decided to go home.  Upon attempting to start the car it was discovered that it was unable to turn over; it was \"dead,\" so-to-speak - very uncharacteristic of this vehicle because the battery was new and maintained regularly.  We supposed that somehow these lights had an effect on the operation of our car.  So, we had to walk home.As the evening progressed we would periodically look outside to see if the lights were still present.  It was midnight when we finally went to bed and the lights continued in place.I must say that the whole experience gave me what I would define as a spooky or unnerving sense of emotion. We returned to our car the next morning; it started without incident.Strangely enough, I spoke to a neighbour about this event.  Earlier in the evening, at about 7pm, he was travelling to his home and witnessed a light or lights travel immediately over his car at a high rate of speed.

There were a few white lights on the center of the under side and the craft made no sound at all. It just seemed to hoover there in the sky.The craft was an oval shape brownist gray in color. there many witnesses to this event. We watched it for about five minutes then continued home.

A friend was with me but she fell asleep just seconds before I saw this brilliant blue like a arc welders light on off ramp grassy area at I 80 interchange at Overton NE. My dashlights turned red. There were other reports of strange lights in area bt were attributed to weather inversions. 67 and 68 were banner years for ufos in midwest. Saw some other strange lights but nothing since. 10 years before that I was at the site of an alleged abduction near Kearney NE. Airforce debunked that as a hoax and the man was rumored as mental case BUT I saw his file. I was later told it was impossible that I would see his file but a lay at the courthouse was evidently as curious as I and she showed me when I asked. The paper from a mental evaluation said he was normal. Later in 1990 I wrote a song about it. In 1993 I wrote a screenplay which became a published audio book. Although most of book was satire; the account was quite accurate. Since my ufo encounter I have become quite a inspired writer and have had dreams that would come true. My latest creation is the \"Millennium Song\" published lyric in a national country music roundup publication Jan 2000. A group Millennium.org should have that in there archive. I also met a actress known for her interest in ufos in early 1970s. That has also inspired my interest. I was a rockabilly on tv in the 50s and folk blues writer from 60s till now.

Is NICAP still in service?  I was returning from playing for a dance. By the way I am not a drinker except on NYears Eve. Far and few between back then too. A friend was with me but she fell asleep just seconds before I saw this brilliant blue like a arc welders light on off ramp grassy area at I 80 interchange at Overton NE. My dashlights turned red. There were other reports of strange lights in area bt were attributed to weather inversions. 67 and 68 were banner years for ufos in midwest. Saw some other strange lights but nothing since. 10 years before that I was at the site of an alleged abduction near Kearney NE. Airforce debunked that as a hoax and the man was rumored as mental case BUT I saw his file. I was later told it was impossible that I would see his file but a lay at the courthouse was evidently as curious as I and she showed me when I asked. The paper from a mental evaluation said he was normal. Later in 1990 I wrote a song about it. In 1993 I wrote a screenplay which became a published audio book. Although most of book was satire; the account was quite accurate. Since my ufo encounter I have become quite a inspired writer and have had dreams that would come true. My latest creation is the \"Millennium Song\" published lyric in a national country music roundup publication Jan 2000. A group Millennium.org should have that in there archive. I also met a actress known for her interest in ufos in early 1970s. That has also inspired my interest. I was a rockabilly on tv in the 50s and folk blues writer from 60s till now.

Dad got a camera and his gun and ran out side. I dont remember much after that. This is the story we were told by our parent and there friends  They would not lie to us for we have witnessed many and i mean many saucer and wierd stuff in the sky for years over the olypmic mt and our lake.  the story is that there was a flying disk with lights around the bottom of the disk flashing the many colors and they could see the port holes (as mom called them) i dont recall if they saw any aliens in windows or not. Dads gun had a scope on it and they looked thru it. The male friend was a very large man and had to huge a big pine tree he was so frightened, my mother ran up the driveway away from the cabin to get away from it,she said and my dad yelled and said we got kids in the house.  she was so frightened. The disk hovered for about 15 to 20 min. if i recall right.  They got many pictures . We were unaware and dont remember much except that us kids were frightened. The next morning the lake was down a foot and there were dead fish floating in the water. We left for home earlier than usual. My parent had family develop the pictures and they called the authorities and newspapers. The newspaper story said da! d shot a t it which he did not and they said it was spotted over whidbey island which it was not. and the pictures were confiscated by the athourities along with the negatives. I did a share and tell at school with the newspaper articule and never did it again. Us kids were ridiculed and told we were weird. We weren't  This kind of observation was natuarl to us girls. We've seen cigar shaped clouds over the lake, we've see orbs, we've seen mothership(main) with 4 or more little lights on either side go into it. Alot of the times we would hear a how would you discribe this sound   woowoo  woowooo humming. We brought friends from school after we moved to cabin permantly 1 1/2 later to see the sky at night at lake and they abserved it also.  We've seen the public access with three prong hole burned into the ground with the grass pressed down. My grandparent even in the 70's and 80's were still observing these sights. Needless to say my parents are dead. We used to wish as kids that they would land and heal our mother of hodgekins disease. Yes they are up their and we girls are messed up because of it. This is true and unreal to anyone else but we lived it for years. Did we get abducted who knows If so they rejected us, The three of us girls are bi-polar and many physical aliaments, but who doesn't have these problems.

The location was Valley Station, Kentucky, about \u00be mile east of Pond Creek on a lightly traveled road with houses and fields.  We were checking out the moon and stars. I tried to sight in a large yellow star directly above us but I just could not get the proper angle, so I shifted the scope to a bright star more along the horizon to the southeast. I was adjusting the focus, with one eye on the eyepiece, and the other eye looking at the ground. My friend started yelling, \"Look\" and at the same time I noticed the ground started to take on a yellow glow.  I looked up and there was an oval shaped glowing and humming craft above us. The craft was about 50 foot by 40 foot and about 15 foot tall at the peak of the center.  It was hovering about 15 feet above the tree top, approximately 100 feet above the ground and slightly to the south of us about 10 feet. It was somewhat elongated (left to right) and the outer edge of the craft was beveled or rounded and had 3 windows along the edge I saw, and the orientation of the craft did not change very much so I don\u2019t know what the other side looked like. The windows were about 1.5 foot wide by 1 foot tall and they were somewhat oval shaped with a bluish white florescent glow inside, but I could only see slightly inside and saw nothing other than a white overhead. There were some sort of recessed/level red lights around it.  We could feel the heat from the craft, no smell other than heat, and as the very low hum rose in pitch, the glow changed from dark yellow to a golden color.  There appeared to be some sort of burnt crusty material on the under surface that was a slightly darker glow. As the hum rose in pitch the craft glowed golden, and then slowly moved about 300 feet to the south over a field. A bright spotlight came out of the bottom of the craft and it scanned the hills from east to the north and stopping directly on us.  The light was of the intensity of a carbon arc search light even thought the light housing was about football size. After the light shown directly on us for about 5 seconds it turned off and the light was retracted inside. The hum then increased rapidly in pitch, the glow was almost white, and the craft raised and move to the west at an ever increasing speed. As it approached the creek something that looked like a chunk of the crusty material from the bottom fell (nobody could find anything) near the creek. As it moved rapidly off to the west in a straight line, it abruptly changed course about 30 degrees to the northwest and faded off into the distance at an incredible speed. Total time: 6 to 7 minutes. From the time it started to move to the west were screaming for my family to come out and see it but they were too late.  We gave my family all the details and I drew a picture of it.  The next day my Aunt, who was visiting one of my uncles at a nearby house, told my mom she saw it too. The one thing about this that still sticks in my mind was the exit. As it changed course, it reminded me the way a stick looks when you put it into a bucket of water, how the image appears to bend.

It was situated on a large, rather remote piece of property.  My dorm room was on the top floor of the main building on the back side under the eaves. The building, itself, was on a hill, so that the back rooms were four floors above ground level.It was just after lights out and I was lying in bed with the windows open.  The room was tiny and the bed was about four feet from the windows, which came down to about two and a half feet above the floor.  I heard a sudden very, very low thrumming noise which appeared to be right over the roof.  It lasted for about three seconds and faded.  I had never heard a sound quite like it and wondered what it had been.  I decided to get up and have a look out the window.  I kneeled down and looked out and saw a saucer-shaped object hovering at my eye level over the tennis courts about fifty feet away.  UFO's were not really in my consciousness at that time, so I didn't comprehend what I was seeing at first. The craft seemed to be shaped like a round clam shell.  It had approximately four or five large colored lights (or lights that changed color - white, red, green) spaced around its rim and it appeared to be revolving slowly because I could see the  lights moving to the back and then reappearing around the other side.  I kept asking myself what on earth this thing was and then suddenly realized with horror that it was a UFO.  I was terrified.  I silently begged it over and over again not to land.  While I watched it, it slowly descended toward the ground.  It stopped and hovered about ten feet above the ground (I couldn't hear the thrumming noise from that distance), then it rose a few feet, it tilted a little one way, then tilted a little another way, then descended again, then rose again.  All of a sudden, without any prior warning movement, it took off from the hovering position at enormous speed and disappeared over the very far off horizon in about two to three seconds. It looked like a star as it disappeared. The horizon was many, many miles away (I was high up on the hill and could see a great distance).The next morning, I went to my Physics teacher and told her what I had seen.  She believed me but told me not to say anything to anyone because I would be labeled a nut, at best, and maybe thrown out of school at worst.  She then confided that she and her husband had recently seen something while they were driving at night, but she dared not tell anyone for fear of losing her job and she swore me to secrecy.My family all said I was hallucinating and I just decided that it must have been some military experimental aircraft that I would soon be seeing flying the skies.  But the years went on and I didn't see it manufactured.  Years later, I was sitting beside a top-level air force officer at a conference, told him what I had seen, and asked him why this experimental craft had never made it into production and use.  He looked at me and said, \"That wasn't a military prototype.  You saw a UFO. We see them all the time.  We have no idea what they are, but they are commonplace.\"  I have to say that it was a relief to have my experience authenticated like that.

We were playing in the car jumping over the seats as there is lots of room in a 1950 Pontiac. It was my brother, now dead that looked up and out the window. He said ''WHAT IS THAT'' !  It was large, about the size of a running track and was a metallic, silver round or saucer shape object. From our angle it did not let us see the top of it.  No speed involved as it was just standing in air, kind of revolving on its own axis at about 60 degrees and it made no sound. The object would often catch the sun and reflect light at us, blinding us momentarily. My father came out to the car and we asked what it was. He looked and said its probably army stuff because their was a radar sight a few miles away.  He finished checking on us and went back into the house he was looking at. My brother did not say any thing until my father left. My brother then told us kids, this was important, this is the time of prop planes. But this thing is standing still and defying gravity.
