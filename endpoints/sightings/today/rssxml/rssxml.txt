As a few minutes passed, I began to hear even more sirens and police cars gathering close by. I walked outside to the end of my driveway to investigate all of the sirens I was hearing. Across the street from me, there was a small home that appeared to have smoke pouring out of it. Obviously I presumed something was on fire inside the home. I watched roughly eight fire trucks arrive on the scene followed by numerous police cars and three ambulances. My home resides behind my landlord who i'm friends with so i sent her a text message to let her know what was going on. She came outside and greeted me and stood beside me while we watched the events of the fire unfold.We stood at the end of the driveway while we watched the fire fighters try to make an entry into the house. Roughly fifteen minutes after watching them, I noticed what seemed to be a solid green colored star slowly descend from the sky.The closer it became, the less it seemed like a star and more like a green orb. The green orb descended until it stopped right above the scene of the fire. At the time I asked my landlord if she could see the same green orb I did to which she agreed.  When it stopped, we could tell that the object had a round figure to it, also it had some mass to it. You could tell that it was large, and it sat just under the clouds right above the home. The object sat there in mid air not moving for a few moments. Suddenly it started moving side to side very slowly.\tWe continued to watch the object shocked and wondering what it was. We kept asking each other what it could be and we couldn't come up with an answer. The green orb would move slowly in one direction, then in the blink of an eye, shoot straight up into the sky. It was almost impossible to keep up with. The object stayed a solid green color and continued to stay directly above the scene of the house fire. It would come down slowly and hover, then move to the side, then gain altitude and ascend into the sky. All of the movements were irregular and hard to keep up with because of how erratic it was. There were times we could see it right under the clouds almost getting close enough to hover right over the treeline that was behind the house, then it would ascend so quickly into the sky it would look like a distant star all over again. Even when it gained altitude, it would stop in mid air and slowly move side to side, then drop down close. Whatever movement it made it seemed t! o have an interest in the lights or the scene of the house fire.As my landlord and I both watched it, we felt nervous and a little shaken up because of the movements this green orb was making. This was no drone because of the speed and altitude it could achieve in mere milliseconds. This was not a meteor or any kind of man piloted aircraft. It did not have any kind of propelling force that moved the object. There was no fire or smoke behind the aircraft. This object moved across the sky back and forth so quickly and slowly that you could tell it did not abide by the natural law of physics. After watching this green orb for about fifteen minutes it would disappear, then reappear on the other side of the sky. My landlord and I struggled to point out to each other where it was disappearing and reappearing. Eventually after it made its erratic movements and kept moving across the sky, the object just simply disappeared. We watched it do this a few times until eventually it never reappeared in the sky.

I am a marines fiance I am sure it was not a normal craft.  it followed meHello I hope you are having a good night, I am the fianc\u00e9 of a marine who\u2019s MOS is Mechanics for large helicopters and planes.  I am familiar with a lot of air crafts because of it.  I live in Ohio.  I was traveling from the Kent University campus to my parents\u2019 house in Uniontown, Ohio.  I was taking a lot of back roads and highways that cut through the countryside, it was mostly corn fields and trees with the occasional house.  Neither of which was lit.I had been on the road for about 5-6 minutes after leaving the Kent campus when I saw the ufo.  I first passed it off as a plane with its headlights towards me (the ufo was a fair distance away at this point so it looked small enough to be a plane)  The only thing that initially made me think its flight path was weird was that it almost seemed to be hugging the tree line from far off, I thought that was low.  I was stopped at a stop light at the time, and I made a choice to ignore it.  But when the stop light turned green, out of the corner of my eye, I saw the object shoot across the sky at a speed I\u2019ve never seen before, and it stopped about what I\u2019m guessing gave it about 5 miles of distance between me and it.That fast movement scared the crap out of me.  I immediately gunned it and took off down the road.  I would occasionally glance around at the sky to see if it followed me because it scared me, but I thought I lost it for a while.  I didn\u2019t see it again till I turned onto the road called Switzer street in Uniontown.  It was sitting dead ahead of me all the way at the end of the road.  It looked like a very bright light at this point I couldn\u2019t make out the shape of the craft because of it.  I just saw the giant ball of light.  At this point it was about half the size of a full moon.I gunned the gas again and made it to my parents\u2019 house and ran inside.  They knew I was coming so the door was unlocked.I didn\u2019t tell my parents about it initially.  I didn\u2019t want them to think I was crazy but when I was leaving the house later, I asked my dad to walk me to the car because I was still unnerved.  He agreed to.  As we walked it showed up again between the tree line.  This time my dad saw it first and told me to look in its direction.\u201cWhat ((words deleted)) is that?\u201d my dad asked, as he walked a bit closer to the edge of our property.\u201cI think its probably just a plane.\u201d  I responded.  I really didn\u2019t want to call it a ufo at that point I was honestly freaked out and was trying to explain it away.\u201cThat\u2019s not a plane, it\u2019s just sitting there not moving.  Planes don\u2019t do that.\u201d  He said, exasperated.No sooner did he say that did the air craft slowly start moving so it swung around and stopped above our back yard.  Still at the same far distance.My dad was spooked at that point and told me to go back in the house with him.  I refused, I wanted to get back to Akron.  I did not want to stay in the country side anymore.  He argued with me, but eventually let me go, if I promised to call him as soon as I got back.  I agreed and climbed into the car and locked the doors.  I watched dad run back inside.  When I looked up at the sky again the ufo was gone.  It was a clear sky tonight. that shouldn't of been possible for it to just disappear like that.I felt a pit in my stomach I did not like what was going on one bit.  I pulled out of the drive way, paranoid, and still watching the sky.  I took off and turned on to a road called Cleveland, Heading back towards Akron.It was a few minutes before I hit my first stop light. It was a red light again.That\u2019s when the ufo showed up again this time it was close!  It was directly above the powerlines that were running up the side of the road.  It turned out its big light and it was replaced with a bunch of small red and blue ones that traced the length of it.  It was very long, almost cigar shaped but thinner.  The lights were evenly spaced out.  Thanks to the lights I could see the ship was about as big as two commercial planes put together.  It had to be at least be 1000 feet in the air still.  Which only leads me to believe it If it had landed, it would have been a crap ton bigger.I gunned a red light to get away from it.  I didn\u2019t see it again till I was merging on the highway.  At that point it was around 10:40pm ish.  I saw the same bright light as I did before, only this time it was at the same distance as it was when I first saw it.  I nervously watched it, it moved out of my sight again, just as I was getting on to I77.  I did not see it again.I called my dad when I got home and explained everything that happened and he gave me your organization's number and told me to report it.I was also asked by the man I talked to on the hotline to give the ufo\u2019s point of elevation.  I am not sure what that is, but I will ask my fianc\u00e9 when he is off duty.  He is stationed in Japan right now, and they are 14 hours ahead of us, so he\u2019s in the middle of his work day. But I will include the point of elevation in an email along with a drawn picture of the ufo.  I just need to find a printer to scan it into.

I am a marines fiance I am sure it was not a normal craft.  it followed meHello I hope you are having a good night, I am the fianc\u00e9 of a marine who\u2019s MOS is Mechanics for large helicopters and planes.  I am familiar with a lot of air crafts because of it.  I live in Ohio.  I was traveling from the Kent University campus to my parents\u2019 house in Uniontown, Ohio.  I was taking a lot of back roads and highways that cut through the countryside, it was mostly corn fields and trees with the occasional house.  Neither of which was lit.I had been on the road for about 5-6 minutes after leaving the Kent campus when I saw the ufo.  I first passed it off as a plane with its headlights towards me (the ufo was a fair distance away at this point so it looked small enough to be a plane)  The only thing that initially made me think its flight path was weird was that it almost seemed to be hugging the tree line from far off, I thought that was low.  I was stopped at a stop light at the time, and I made a choice to ignore it.  But when the stop light turned green, out of the corner of my eye, I saw the object shoot across the sky at a speed I\u2019ve never seen before, and it stopped about what I\u2019m guessing gave it about 5 miles of distance between me and it.That fast movement scared the crap out of me.  I immediately gunned it and took off down the road.  I would occasionally glance around at the sky to see if it followed me because it scared me, but I thought I lost it for a while.  I didn\u2019t see it again till I turned onto the road called Switzer street in Uniontown.  It was sitting dead ahead of me all the way at the end of the road.  It looked like a very bright light at this point I couldn\u2019t make out the shape of the craft because of it.  I just saw the giant ball of light.  At this point it was about half the size of a full moon.I gunned the gas again and made it to my parents\u2019 house and ran inside.  They knew I was coming so the door was unlocked.I didn\u2019t tell my parents about it initially.  I didn\u2019t want them to think I was crazy but when I was leaving the house later, I asked my dad to walk me to the car because I was still unnerved.  He agreed to.  As we walked it showed up again between the tree line.  This time my dad saw it first and told me to look in its direction.\u201cWhat ((words deleted)) is that?\u201d my dad asked, as he walked a bit closer to the edge of our property.\u201cI think its probably just a plane.\u201d  I responded.  I really didn\u2019t want to call it a ufo at that point I was honestly freaked out and was trying to explain it away.\u201cThat\u2019s not a plane, it\u2019s just sitting there not moving.  Planes don\u2019t do that.\u201d  He said, exasperated.No sooner did he say that did the air craft slowly start moving so it swung around and stopped above our back yard.  Still at the same far distance.My dad was spooked at that point and told me to go back in the house with him.  I refused, I wanted to get back to Akron.  I did not want to stay in the country side anymore.  He argued with me, but eventually let me go, if I promised to call him as soon as I got back.  I agreed and climbed into the car and locked the doors.  I watched dad run back inside.  When I looked up at the sky again the ufo was gone.  It was a clear sky tonight. that shouldn't of been possible for it to just disappear like that.I felt a pit in my stomach I did not like what was going on one bit.  I pulled out of the drive way, paranoid, and still watching the sky.  I took off and turned on to a road called Cleveland, Heading back towards Akron.It was a few minutes before I hit my first stop light. It was a red light again.That\u2019s when the ufo showed up again this time it was close!  It was directly above the powerlines that were running up the side of the road.  It turned out its big light and it was replaced with a bunch of small red and blue ones that traced the length of it.  It was very long, almost cigar shaped but thinner.  The lights were evenly spaced out.  Thanks to the lights I could see the ship was about as big as two commercial planes put together.  It had to be at least be 1000 feet in the air still.  Which only leads me to believe it If it had landed, it would have been a crap ton bigger.I gunned a red light to get away from it.  I didn\u2019t see it again till I was merging on the highway.  At that point it was around 10:40pm ish.  I saw the same bright light as I did before, only this time it was at the same distance as it was when I first saw it.  I nervously watched it, it moved out of my sight again, just as I was getting on to I77.  I did not see it again.I called my dad when I got home and explained everything that happened and he gave me your organization's number and told me to report it.I was also asked by the man I talked to on the hotline to give the ufo\u2019s point of elevation.  I am not sure what that is, but I will ask my fianc\u00e9 when he is off duty.  He is stationed in Japan right now, and they are 14 hours ahead of us, so he\u2019s in the middle of his work day. But I will include the point of elevation in an email along with a drawn picture of the ufo.  I just need to find a printer to scan it into.  I was unable to get a physical picture of the ufo because I was driving for most of this sighting.I hope this was helpful!

I was sitting on my front porch listening to music, and since I like to listen to aircraft passing, I decided to pull my headphones off.  The strange thing was that there was no sound.  This light was hovering over that house for about a minute or so.  The light was very bright, but oddly enough, not so bright that I couldn't look directly at it.  I'm located in the Columbia area, and I could tell that I was facing north when looking at this object.That bright white light shut off.  What replaced that bright white light was a green and red light pattern.  It's difficult to explain, but the lights appeared to be one and the same, and yet separate at the same time.  This craft still didn't move and I could tell because it didn't appear to be getting bigger or smaller.  I couldn't make out the exact shape of the craft, but I could tell it was big.  It was like looking into the dark to see a blurry figure and you can't tell the exact shape but you can tell how big or small it was.  This thing was huge. I'd say it was the size of a C-130.About 20 seconds after the bright white light changed to the green and red light combination it shot off to the East at a speed that was ridiculous.  This was weird because it went from a stand still, to shooting off at such a fast speed.  There was no build up to the speed.  That kind of maneuver seems ridiculous because that has to be technology I've never seen before that allows an aircraft to go from a stand still hovering position to speeds I haven't seen fighter jets match.  It didn't make sense how fast this thing was, and yet there was still no sound.I couldn't believe what I saw so I stood up and looked around for neighbors.  I spotted one such neighbor who happened to be an Air Force veteran and we talked a lot because I'm an Army veteran.  I asked him if he saw anything weird.  He told me that for several nights he saw the same thing.  He too said there was no sound to this aircraft he was witnessing.  He said it didn't seem like a drone because drones don't move like what he saw and he thought it was weird he never heard any sounds coming from this object.I decided to call Shaw Air Force base.

I hoped for another day where it would come again while I was not alone so I wouldn't feel so crazy when explaining a huge flying flame right over my head with black gases rolling around in it to people. lol  I honestly keep it a little hush because it is so bizarre.Well tonight, at about 10:20 pm almost exactly a year later, finally, I saw it again and it was moving through the same exact area as I saw it last time, my sisters yard.  It was not nearly as close to me as the last one was, therefor it wasn't as large, but the plus side to tonights odd fireball sighting was that my sister and my niece both saw the flying orange flame right along side of me.  My skeptical side thought Chinese lantern at first due to its size BUT I quickly changed my mind.   We watched it travel through the yard at about the height of the tree line, moving west in a straight line, not up, not down, but mostly straight, much faster than the one I saw last year, it continued a good straight distance then up a little higher to avoid some trees then straight again until it appeared to stop about a mile or two away where it hovered and began slowly changing colors from orange to red to green to a silver/white color while just hovering.  Seemed to be a little above the! tree line at this point and way below the skyline.  It remained in that same exact spot for at least 30 minutes.

Looked to the right of us, eastwardly, and there it was back in the direction of our house again where we had just left from about another two miles away.  Almost as if to avoid us.  How did it get from in front of our car to 2 miles away in another direction in a matter of 2 seconds? Again, I am so baffled. We all are! And Last year, even though my sister and niece experienced the huge white streak across the sky about 20 minutes after my first fireball sighting, I am so very glad that someone else finally saw t! he orange flame object that I saw last year! I just wish it wa! s closer like it was last year. Don't get me wrong... It was still very close but not nearly as close as it came to me last year. BUT This time my video worked :) and I have a lot of pictures. Im thinking it was so close to me last time that it interfered with my cell and it also knocked our cable out. This time, there was a little distance so my phone did not fail! But the same exact thing happened where it appears much much smaller in video and pictures than what we visually saw. Also the shape changes in the video and pictures than what we visually witnessed as well. Its so bizarre and I feel like a crazy person when I try to explain it lol A couple pics and the video showed two and three fireballs but we could only see one with our eyes.

We used a degree finder to be as close to  how much of an angle we were watching.  The degree finder gave us a value of 197\u00b0 until each of them went straight up, so high as to we couldn\u2019t see then anymore and basically they blinked out.

She definitely did NOT get worked up as much as I did, because again I wasn\u2019t sure what exactly it was we were watching.OK, I do have an update as to the direction they were traveling.  You asked what direction the travel was.  As by compass the (Crafts) or whatever, they were came from the Southeast and was traveling I the direction of the Northwest.

The closest we can come with since all we can seem to get are recorded messages, but the wind speed at about 3000\u2019 was North West at about 10mph.  At 6000\u2019 they weren\u2019t very clear but again North West at between 15 and 20mph.  You also requested to contact the F.A.A., that was a total joke especially in this area, all we could get were recorded messages, NO matter what department we pushed the buttons on the phone to get to.  All  we could get were recorded messages then when finished, there were NO areas to leave a message it just simply just hangs up.  To be honest, right now I am almost sorry I reported what my wife and I were watching and probably will NOT do so in the future.We are trying very hard to do the right thing and make the calls you requested we make and all we seem to get is stonewalled.  I really don\u2019t need this.  Right now we have about five (5) hours trying to report what we were watching.  Again like I explained, I did contact our newspaper office, again to get a recording.  And in the past 5 and \u00bd hours they have refused to return the telephone call, I know because of what it was.  OK, I am going to try to get six (6) radio stations involved and two (2) two Television Stations, and hopefully again we will NOT get stonewalled again.  Up here I already have over 20 people looking down their noses at us.  This is really making the both of feel like fools.  Again, you are right, I cannot possibly tell you the exact speed and height of the (crafts) we were watching.  I have a very close guess since we do have an airport very close to us and watch jet aircraft all the time and 1 and 2 times the speed of sound.  Normally, anytime this happens there is a very large sonic boom.  These (crafts) last night were totally and I mean totally silent.You asked about the size of the (crafts) against a possible full moon, We both can tell you our guess they were at least 10,000\u2019 feet up but they were large enough even at that height these (crafts) were would completely cover a full moon plus some.  And according what I could see against a very clear sky,  Above the very bright RED and Yellow lighting, the (crafts) appeared to be a saucer shape.  Again, the sky was clear as a bell.We hope this answers some of the questions you had, especially since we are getting stonewalled where ever we have called, now we are getting laughed at by the media also.

I have tried very hard to get them to come forward with you and submit a report also.  This is with NO avail, they are all too afraid of being laughed at.  Personally, I don\u2019t give a d**** what other people think, this is what my wife and I were watching, and other that being stonewalled with the National Weather Service, the F.A.A. and the news media I just simply want you to know what we were seeing.My curiosity is very high to know exactly what those (crafts) were we were watching.", "title": 182, "description": "In Chico CA on 4/18/14 22:01 for approximately 29.0 to 29.0 minutes witness reports: 'After going on the back porch for a smoke, what I saw was unbeliveable, we moved to the parking lot for a better unobstructed view.UPDATED REPORT AS REQUESTED. . . . . . . . .Again, until the 911 operator called me back, I didn\u2019t even know a National UFO Reporting Center even existed.You requested to place our fingers where we first saw what was flying over to where they had climbed out of sight and blinked out.

I first noticed two bright orange-colored lights moving across the night sky as I was driving Northeast on E. 1st Avenue in the city of Chico, CA.\tI immediately pointed out the lights to my 13 year-old daughter, who asked me what I thought they were.  I pulled the car over at the nearest safe place, at 1035 Village Lane.  We exited the car and immediately noticed that several other lights were appearing over the trees from the horizon.  We were facing the Southeast.\tThe lights would appear over the horizon from the Southeast and travel Westward.  The lights appeared in pairs as if they were in a formation.  The lights had a steady, light-orange tint to them and were fairly large.  It was hard to judge their size, but I'm familiar with how bright and large Venus can appear, so I would approximate their size as if 5 or more Venuses were put together into a single object.  The objects would travel in a straight course, heading Westward and then disappear from the sky.  No noise was emitted from the objects.  We observed the lights for a total of about 10 minutes.  Most of the objects appeared to have a constant speed, with one object being fairly faster than the others.During this period of observation my daughter took a one-minute video of some of the objects with her ipod.

Both she and my 16 year-old son went to the front yard and saw some of the lights my daughter and I observed in the Western sky.

First she saw two separate lights come close together and they appeared to cross each others flight path.  One light continued on its flight path, while the other turned into three distinct luminous objects, and then quickly merged into one object again.It is interesting to note that this observation was made in the medium-sized city (population 87,000) of Chico, CA.

As I tried to figure out what this was, it proceeded to fly up in the air, go above and over my horse trailer, back down a little and out of sight of the camera.  I sat there, staring for a moment when I saw something else moving around the horse trailer.  It was like a light beam- a thin beam of light yet there was no change in width.  It was the same width as far as I could see it and also \"skipped\" some space in the beam.  Like a pole with occasional dead space. As I watched this beam move around the hprse trailer- like it was scoping something out- it moved above the trailer and \"did a little dance\" then back down and around the trailer again.

Both objects were stationary in the sky, one a very bright yellow and and the other a bright blue. They were probably less than a mile apart from each other.  Each object was not moving and it was easy to tell they were not planes because several planes were flying nearby them.  They both would become more/less intense in brightness at certain times and seemed to be diamond shaped.  The blue colored one appeard to be flickering heavily and very noticebly changing colors from red, blue, green, yellow, etc.. at one point the object appeared to come apart into about 4 separate points of light and then returned together after about 5 seconds.

Both objects were stationary in the sky, one a very bright yellow and and the other a bright blue. They were probably less than a mile apart from each other.  Each object was not moving and it was easy to tell they were not planes because several planes were flying nearby them.  They both would become more/less intense in brightness at certain times and seemed to be diamond shaped.  The blue colored one appeard to be flickering heavily and very noticebly changing colors from red, blue, green, yellow, etc.. at one point the object appeared to come apart into about 4 separate points of light and then returned together after about 5 seconds.

Directly ahead of us, (guessing over Cumberland Heights area was where it was) my husband and I both watched as this oddly shaped tangerine/peach colored rectangle passed in front of our field of vision going in a northerly direction.I say oddly shaped because the leading edge had well defined 90 degree edges on it and the length was consistent with a rectangle, but the back end was less well defined almost as if it was fading or in a mist at the back end.  The colors were very pretty and bright, and kind of rippled with different shades of orange, tangerine, peach, and even a little pinkish or salmon color.We were far enough away to see it in its entirety, and we saw no other aircraft around (at first I thought it might be a banner pulled behind a plane, but the sky was otherwise empty).  My husband suggested it was a blimp, but the shape was wrong, as was the area, for the area is very rural.We watched it as we continued our drive into town for about 4 minutes and my husband even sped up to get closer to it so that we could see it in more detail.  The closer we got, the more vivid the colors were.  We were also able to say without doubt that it was not being powered by or pulled behind any other craft in the sky.  We were trying to get close enough to see if it had any marking or writing on it, but as soon as we got close enough, the road went between two tree covered hills and we lost sight.  I would say that when we lost sight of the craft we were approximately 200 yards away and the craft was flying about 150 feet high, just over the tops of the trees on the hills that surround the road.  It didn't leave any con-trail, unless the 'mistiness' of the back end would qualify, and it didn't seem to make any noise, but our distance from the craft and the fact we were in a moving vehicle could have been the reason we heard nothing.As we came out of the hills, my children (age 11 and 14) and I scoured the sky behind us and to the north for the rest of the drive in, but didn't see it again.

There was no loud sound, but I was in car with windows closed.      In the  middle of back two lights, on one craft, can't remember if it was front or back - a blinking light was seen.They were very close together and moving not very fast.I realise it could have been planes heading for MacDill AFB nearby, but they were very close together to be large transport planes and moving very slowly for jets and also too wide for jets.

I lost sight for a minute when I arrived home and parked and exited my car. I looked in the general vicinity where I originally seen this and what I thought was an extremely bright star caught my eye. I didn't watch it continually at first but kept glancing back as I carried groceries in. Then I stopped and watched it closer. It was only white at this time. I noticed that it didn't look like a typical twinkling star because it was so much brighter. Then it seemed to be shimmying a little or maybe slightly wavering from side to side. The light on it then appeared to be scanning. I called my mother to get her to watch it. She agreed it was moving and the light appeared to be going around in circles or scanning.

Once the bright light disappeared, many small apparent strobe lights became prominent.  The apparent strobe lights were not noticed until the bright light disappeared and at that time the apparent strobe lights departed the visible sky in all directions until no longer visible.

Once the brighter flashing light disappeared, we noted that the movement of the strobe lights was consistent with the general direction of the movement of the brighter flashing light until they departed the area.

It was gigantic--being at least two hundred feet long and maybe 60-75  high.  Along the top of the object were a line of blue lights - maybe five or six and along the bottom maybe 8-10 white lights and another 10 along the side-somewhat like halogen lights and constant - no strobe or on or off.
