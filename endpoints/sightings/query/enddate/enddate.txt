I notice the lakes, the size, (i love observing land shapes beneath me), anyways I spotted a red giant ball shape ( in flame type on top of a mountain), I thought it was a fire truck, (I realze Im so high into the sky) that it can't be, because I just passed some waters, and they are only a size of half my plans...The red light ball rolled down the mountains, travel between the hills, up another mountain, traveled on top of the ridges, and disappeared...What got my attention was the spead it went up the mountian, and how fast it traveled in the terrain..."}
