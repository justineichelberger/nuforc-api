As I looked to see what the comotion was I saw a bright object flying from east to west. The object was apparently at the altitude of 30,000 feet. I observed the object flying on a straight path, then it begain to zig-zag. The side to side motions were approximately 8-10 times the width of the object. It zig-zaged 4 times then flew straight for about the same distance and repeated the zig-zag motion. I turned away from the object for a moment then looked back in the direction but couldn't find it anymore."}
