Every night I hear an airplane like turbulence noise.  Usually I think nothing of it, but this morning the noise sounded so close that it caused my bed and walls to move and my ears feel like they would pop.  The sound zooms over my house, so I get up to look out the window.  I see a red light (shown in the video I Emailed).  It moves slowly toward East and stays there for a good 30 min.  Then moves back North and stays.  It starts to flash a light towards the ground. It does that twice, almost like in a circle.  Then the third time it flashes at my window.  I freak out and decide to go back to bed (my cat in my bed also was scared. She started to meow weirdly, like she does when begging for water, but she didn\u2019t move to drink). I\u2019m not sure when the light stopped shining because I fell asleep.  I didn't want to tell anyone, because I thought maybe it was a helicopter possibly looking for someo! ne.  Then in the morning my four year old sister, getting ready for school, tells my mom that someone was knocking on the window last night and she was scared to leave her bed to wake my mom.  My mom thinks nothing of it.  I show my mom the video and she tells me what my little sister told her.  At first I thought maybe it was me she heard because I was by the window to film.  When my sister leaves school, I ask her a few questions (I Obviously didnt tell her that it may be aliens because she would never sleep again).  We ask if it was a bang or a knock.  She said it was a Continuous knock that caused her to wake up.  We asked what window and she said the one by her bed, NOT the one I was recording out of.  My mom then asked if she saw anything, and she said she saw a person with no hair.  I asked if it was fat and she said no, that he was very skinny.  I don\u2019t know how reliable a four year olds word is, but I got chills."}
