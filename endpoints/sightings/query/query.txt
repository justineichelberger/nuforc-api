Also I looked to see if there was any stars in the direc! tion of the thing but I did not see any so the thing must have been really bright; I don't know if that means anything but that's what I observed. And sorry I did not have a camera on me to take pictures but I wish I did to show exactly what me and my brother saw.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.
