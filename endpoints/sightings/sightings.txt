It was not the ISS as I looked at the schedule.  I have seen the ISS fly over my house and even though it seems to move quickly across the sky, this object was noticeably faster.  If it was an aircraft at high altitude it was moving extraordinarily quickly!  I have never seen a distant object move this fast across the sky, including the ISS."}
