Then I see these to really bright lights that were whitish with a touch of bluey green in them. They were two discs flying side by side, very close to each other. They entered our atmosphere fast heading towards the ground, then they do a massive U turn and disappear into the night. Basically they did a giant U turn (entering and then leaving our planet). At there lowest point they were maybe 1 km from the ground. The sighting only lasted about 10 seconds. As they got closer to the ground, they got much bigger. Its hard to tell how big they were because the light they were emitting was so bright, but I would say they were at least 50 metres across........ Im so happy I saw it as I was literally turning around to go back inside as I saw it. If they had have come 2 seconds later I would have missed them completely......."}
